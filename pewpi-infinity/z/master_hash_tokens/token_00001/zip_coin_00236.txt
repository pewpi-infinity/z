1) the wang-sheeley-arge (wsa) semi-empirical solar coronal model, and 2) the enlil magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) heliospheric model. mhd modeling of the full domain (solar photosphere to earth) is extremely computationally demanding due to the large parameter space and resulting characteristic speeds within the system. to reduce the computational burden and improve the timeliness (and hence the utility in forecasting space weather disturbances) of model results, the domain of the mhd model (enlil) is limited from 21.5 solar radii (r_s) to just beyond the orbit of earth, while the inner portion, spanning from the solar photosphere to 21.5r_s, is characterized by the wsa model. this coupled modeling system is driven by solar synoptic maps composed of numerous magnetogram observations from the national solar observatoryâs (nso) global oscillation network group (gong). such maps provide a full surface description of solar photospheric magnetic flux density, while not accounting for the evolution of surface features for regions outside the view of the observatories. in its current configuration (noaa wsa-enlil v3.0), the modeling system consists of wsa v5.4 and enlil v2.9e. the system relies upon the zero point corrected gong synoptic maps (mrzqs) to define the inner photospheric boundary. the operational data files provided in this bucket include netcdf files containing 3-dimensional gridded neutral density from 100 to 1000 km, total electron content (tec), and maximum usable frequency (muf). the full 3d datasets from the operational model are provided here as compressed tar files with naming convention wsa_enlil.mrid########.full3d.tgz. these files consist of the full set of 3d datacubes (tim. .nc), all time series results stored at predefined observation points (evo. .nc), and supplemented by the operational cme fits (conefiles) and the operationally... details → noaa whole atmosphere model-ionosphere plasmasphere electrodynamics (wam-ipe) forecast system (wfs) climate meteorological solar weather the coupled whole atmosphere model-ionosphere plasmasphere electrodynamics (wam-ipe) forecast system (wfs) is developed and maintained by the noaa space weather prediction center (swpc). the wam-ipe model provides a specification of ionosphere and thermosphere conditions with real-time nowcasts and forecasts up to two days in advance in response to solar, geomagnetic, and lower atmospheric forcing. the wam is an extension of the global forecast system (gfs) with a spectral hydrostatic dynamical core utilizing an enthalpy thermodynamic variable to 150 vertical levels on a hybrid pressure-sigma grid, with a model top of approximately 3 x 10-7 pa (typically 400-600km depending on levels of solar activity). additional upper atmospheric physics and chemistry, including electrodynamics and plasma processes, are included. the ipe model provides the plasma component of the atmosphere. it is a time-dependent, global 3d model of
