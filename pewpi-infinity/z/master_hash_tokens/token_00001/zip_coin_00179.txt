histopathology life sciences this page describes the cobra (classification of basal cell carcinoma, risky skin cancers and abnormalities) skin pathology dataset, which comprises over 7000 histopathology whole-slide-images related to the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma skin cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancer. the dataset includes biopsies and excisions and is divided into four groups. the first group contains about 2,500 bcc biopsies with subtype labels, while the second group includes 2,500 non-bcc biopsies with different types of skin dysplasia. the third group has 1,000 labelled risky cancer biopsies, includin... details → usage examples cobra tools & labels by diagnostic image analysis group, radboudumc, nijmegen asap viewer by geert litjens whole slide data - python package for working with wholeslide images and annotations files by diagnostic image analysis group, radboudumc, nijmegen see 3 usage examples → covid-19 harmonized data coronavirus covid-19 life sciences a harmonized collection of the core data pertaining to covid-19 reported cases by geography, in a format prepared for analysis details → usage examples how talend is joining the fight against covid-19 by thomas bennett tap covid-19 python by jeff huth stitch covid-19 integration by jeff huth see 3 usage examples → cz grand challenges - imaging mit licensed data and models biodiversity bioinformatics biology biomolecular modeling brain images cell biology cell imaging czi imaging life sciences machine learning microscopy model protein zarr this dataset contains a diverse range of imaging biological data and models. the data is sourced and curated by a team of experts at czi and is made available as part of these datasets only when it is not publicly accessible or requires transformations to support model training. details → usage examples documentation for subcell by czi cell-diff: unified diffusion modeling for protein sequences and microscopy images by zheng dihan, bo huang quickstart tutorial for subcell by czi quickstart tutorial for cell-diff by czi documentation for cell-diff by czi see 6 usage examples → cz grand challenges - transcriptomic mit licensed data and models biodiversity biology biomolecular modeling cell biology czi hdf5 life sciences machine learning model protein transcriptomics this dataset contains a transcriptomics biological data and models. the models embed transcriptomic data and facilitate transcriptomic analysis. the data is sourced and curated by a team of experts at czi and is made available as part of these datasets only when it is not publicly accessible or requires transformations to support model training. details → usage examples scgenept: is language all you need for modeling single-cell perturbations?
