their hydrologically contributing areas. it is defined on a latitude/longitude spatial grid with a mesh length of 30 arc seconds (~800 m), and a temporal resolution of one hour. elements include hourly total precipitation, temperature, specific humidity, terrain-level pressure, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, and west-east and south-north wind components. it spans the period from 1979 across the continental u.s. (conus) and from 1981 across alaska, to the near-present (at all locations). this suite of eight variables is sufficient to drive most land-surface and hydrologic models and is used as input to the national water model (nwm) retrospective simulation. while the native aorc process generates netcdf output, the data is post-processed to create a cloud optimized zarr formatted equivalent for dissemination using cloud technology and infrastructure. aorc version 1.1 dataset creation the aorc dataset was created after reviewing, identifying, and processing multiple large-scale, observation, and analysis datasets. there are two versions of the analysis of record for calibration (aorc) data. the initial aorc version 1.0 dataset was completed in november 2019 and consisted of a grid with 8 elements at a resolution of 30 arc seconds. the aorc version 1.1 dataset was created to address issues " see table 1 in fall et al., 2023 " in the version 1.0 conus dataset. full documentation on version 1.1 of the aorc data and the related journal publication are provided below. the native aorc version 1.1 process creates a dataset that consists of netcdf files with the following dimensions: 1 hour, 4201 latitude values (ranging from 25.0 to 53.0), and 8401 longitude values (ranging from -125.0 to -67). the data creation runs with a 10-day lag to ensure the inclusion of any corrections to the input stage iv and nldas data. note - the full extent of the aorc grid as defined in its data files exceed those cited above; those outermost rows and columns of data grids are filled with missing values and are the remnant of an early set of required aorc extents that have since been adjusted inward. aorc version 1.1 zarr conversion the goal for converting the aorc data from netcdf to zarr was to allow users to quickly and efficiently load/use the data. for example, one year of data takes 28 mins to load via netcdf while only taking 3.2 seconds to load via zarr (resulting in a substantial increase in speed). for longer periods of time, the percentage increase in speed using zarr (vs netcdf) is even higher. using zarr also leads to less memory and cpu utilization. it was determined that the optimal conversion for the data was 1 year worth of zarr files with a chunk size of 18mb. the chunking was completed across all 8 variables. the chunks consist of the following dimensions: 144 time, 128 latitude, and 256 longitude. to create the files in the zarr format, the netcdf files were rechunked using chunk() and " xarray ". after chunking the files, they were converted to a monthly zarr file. then, each monthly zarr file was combined using " to_zarr " to create a zarr file that represents a full year users wanting more than 1 year of data will be able to utilize zarr utilities/libraries to combine multiple years up to the span of the full data set. there are eight variables representing the meteorological conditions total precipitaion (apcp_surface) hourly total precipitation (kgm-2 or mm) for calibration (aorc) dataset air temperature (tmp_2maboveground) temperature (at 2 m above-ground-level (agl)) (k) specific humidity (spfh_2maboveground) specific humidity (at 2 m agl) (g g-1) downward long-wave radiation flux (dlwrf_surface) longwave (infrared) radiation flux (at the surface) (w m-2) downward short-wave radiation flux (dswrf_surface) downward shortwave (solar) radiation flux (at the surface) (w m-2) pressure (pres_surface) air pressure (at the surface) (pa) **u-component of wind (ugrd_10maboveground)" 1)u (west-east) - components of the wind (at 10 m agl) (m s-1) **v-component of wind (vgrd_10maboveground)" v (south-north) - components of the wind (at 10 m agl) (m s-1) precipitation and temperature the gridded aorc precipitation dataset contains one-hour accumulated surface precipitation (apcp) ending at the âtopâ of each hour, in liquid water-equivalent units (kg m-2 to the nearest 0.1 kg m-2), while the gridded aorc temperature dataset is comprised of instantaneous, 2 m above-ground-level (agl) temperatures at the top of each hour (in kelvin, to the nearest 0.1). specific humidity, pressure, downward radiation, wind ... details → usage examples the office of water prediction's analysis of record for calibration, version 1.1: dataset description and precipitation evaluation (09 july 2023). j. am. water resour. assoc., 59 (6). 1246-1272. by greg fall, david kitzmiller, sandra pavlovic, ziya zhang, nathan patrick, michael st. laurent, carl trypaluk, wanru wu, and dennis miller explore the aorc 1.1 dataset in zarr by michael aucoin see 2 usage examples → noaa climate forecast system (cfs) agriculture climate meteorological weather the climate forecast system (cfs) is a model representing the global interaction between earth's oceans, land, and atmosphere. produced by several dozen scientists under guidance from the national centers for environmental prediction (ncep), this model offers hourly data with a horizontal resolution down to one-half of a degree (approximately 56 km) around earth for many variables. cfs uses the latest scientific approaches for taking in, or assimilating, observations from data sources including surface observations, upper air balloon observations, aircraft observations, and satellite obser... details → usage examples the ncep climate forecast system version 2 by saha, suranjana, and coauthors the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis by saha, suranjana, and coauthors see 2 usage examples → noaa global forecast system (gfs) netcdf formatted data agriculture climate disaster response environmental meteorological weather the global forecast system (gfs) is a weather forecast model produced by the national centers for environmental prediction (ncep). dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. the gfs data files stored here can be immediately used for oar/arlâs noaa-epa atmosphere-chemistry coupler cloud (nacc-cloud) tool , and are in a network
