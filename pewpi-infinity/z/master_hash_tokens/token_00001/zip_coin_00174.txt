upgrade ncep global forecast system to v16.3.0 - effective november 29, 2022 see notification here the global forecast system (gfs) is a weather forecast model produced by the national centers for environmental prediction (ncep). dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. the entire globe is covered by the gfs at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid points, which is used by the operational forecasters who predict weather out to 16 days in the future. horizontal resolution drops to 44 miles (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week and two weeks. the noaa global forecast systems (gfs) warm start initial conditions are produced by the national centers for environmental prediction center (ncep) to run operational deterministic medium-range numerical weather predictions. the gfs is built with the gfdl finite-volume cubed-sphere dynamical core (fv3) and the grid-point statistical interpolation (gsi) data assimilation system. please visit the links below in the documentation section to find more details about the model and the data... details → usage examples noaa global forecast system (gfs) quickstart notebook on aws by benoit de chateauvieux validation and application of the accu-waves operational platform for wave forecasts at ports by christos makris et al. toward the next generation of microwave sounders: benefits of a low-earth orbit hyperspectral microwave instrument in all- weather conditions using ai by eric s. maddy gfs warm restart files additional information by fanglin yang see 4 usage examples → noaa global historical climatology network daily (ghcn-d) agriculture climate meteorological weather update to ghcn prefixes -
