predicted concentrations of all species in the lowest model layer (i.e., the layer in contact with the surface) are available, as are vertically integrated values of smoke and dust. the data is gridded horizontally within each domain, with a grid spacing of approximately 5 km over conus, 6 km over alaska, and 2.5 km over hawaii. o3 concentrations are provided in parts per billion (ppb), while the concentrations of all other species are quantified in units of micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3), except for the column-integrated smoke values which are expressed in units of milligrams per square meter (mg/m2). temporally, o3 and pm2.5 are available as maximum and/or averaged values over various time periods, selected in part for consistency with the epaâs national ambient air quality standards. specifically, o3 is available in both 1-hour and 8-hour (backward calculated) averages, as well as preceding 1-hour and 8-hour maximum values. similarly, pm2.5 is available in 1-hour and 24-hour average values and 24-hour maximum values. in addition, all o3 and pm2.5 fields are available with bias-corrected magnitudes, based on derived historical model biases relative to observations. the aqm produ... details → usage examples development and evaluation of an advanced national air quality forecasting capability using the noaa global forecast system version 16 (2022, geosci. model dev., 15, 3281â3313) by campbell, p.c., and coauthors using viirs fire radiative power data to simulate biomass burning emissions, plume rise and smoke transport in a real-time air quality modeling system (proc. 2017 ieee int. geoscience and remote sensing symp.
