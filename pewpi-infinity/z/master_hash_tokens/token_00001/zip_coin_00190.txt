measurement file (2023-04-03) is an intermediate output of the 2020 census disclosure avoidance system (das) topdown algorithm (tda) (as described in abowd, j. et al [2022] https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.529e3cb9 , and implemented in https://github.com/uscensusbureau/das_2020_redistricting_production_code ). the nmf was produced using the official âproduction settings,â the final set of algorithmic parameters and privacy-loss budget allocations, that were used to produce the 2020 census redistricting data (p.l. 94-171) summary file and the 2020 census demographic and housing characteristics file. the nmf consists of the full set of privacy-protected statistical queries (counts of individuals or housing units with particular combinations of characteristics) of confidential 2010 census data relating to the redistricting data portion of the 2010 demonstration data products suite â redistricting and demographic and housing characteristics file â production settings (2023-04-03). these statistical queries, called ânoisy measurementsâ were produced under the zero-concentrated differential privacy framework (bun, m. and steinke, t [2016] https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065 ; see also dwork c. and roth, a. [2014] https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/papers/privacybook.pdf ) implemented via the discrete gaussian mechanism (cannone c., et al., [2023] https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010 ), which added positive or negative integer-valued noise to each of the resulting counts. the noisy measurements are an intermediate stage of the tda prior to the post-processing the tda then performs to ensure internal and hierarchical consistency within the resulting tables. the census bureau has released these 2010 census demonstration data to enable data users to evaluate the expected impact of disclosure avoidance variability on 2020 census data. the 2010 census production settings redistricting data (p.l.94-171) demonstration noisy measurement file (2023-04-03) has been cleared for public dissemination by the census bureau disclosure review board (cbdrb-fy22-dsep-004). the data includes zero-concentrated differentially private (zcdp) (bun, m. and steinke, t [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete gaussian mechanism. these are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2010 census edited file (cef), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2010 census of population and housing. the noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the topdown algorithm (tda) to produce the 2010 census production settings privacy-protected microdata file - redistricting (p.l. 94-171) and demographic and housing characteristics file (2023-04-03) ( https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/data-product-planning/2010-demonstration-data-products/04-demonstration_data_products_suite/2023-04-03/ ). as these 2010 census demonstration data are intended to support study of the design and expected impacts of the 2020 disclosure avoidance system, the 2010 cef records were pre-processed before application of the zcdp framework. this pre-processing converted the 2010 cef records into the input-file format, response codes, and tabulation categories used for the 2020 census, which differ in substantive ways from the format, response codes, and tabulation categories originally used for the 2010 census. the nmf provides estimates of counts of... details → usage examples geographic spines in the 2020 census disclosure avoidance system by abowd, j., ashmead, r., cumings-menon, r., garfinkel, s., heineck, m., heiss, c., johns, r., kifer, d., leclerc, p., machanavajjhala, a., moran, b., sexton, w., spence, m., zhuravlev, p. the 2020 census disclosure avoidance system topdown algorithm by abowd, j., ashmead, r., cumings-menon, r., garfinkel, s., heineck, m., heiss, c., johns, r., kifer, d., leclerc, p., machanavajjhala, a., moran, b., sexton, w., spence, m., zhuravlev, p. see 2 usage examples → 2020 census redistricting data (p.l. 94-171) noisy measurement file census differential privacy disclosure avoidance ethnicity group quarters housing housing units noisy measurements population race redistricting voting age the 2020 census redistricting data (p.l. 94-171) noisy measurement file (nmf) is an intermediate output of the 2020 census disclosure avoidance system (das) topdown algorithm (tda) (as described in abowd, j. et al [2022] https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.529e3cb9 , and implemented in the das 2020 redistricting production code ). the nmf was generated using the census bureau's implementation of the discrete gaussian mechanism , calibrated to satisfy zero-concentrated differential privacy with bounded neighbors . the nmf values, called noisy measurements are the output of applying the discrete gaussian mechanism to counts from the 2020 census edited file (cef). they are generally inconsistent with one another (for example, in a county composed of two tracts, the noisy measurement for the county's total population may not equal the sum of the noisy measurements of the two tracts' total population), and frequently negative (especially when the population being measured was small), but are integer-valued. the nmf was later post-processed as part of the das code to take the form of microdata and to satisfy various constraints. the nmf documented here contains both the noisy measurements themselves as well as the data needed to represent the das constraints; thus, the nmf could be used to reproduce the steps taken by the das code to produce microdata from the noisy measurements by applying the production code base . the 2020 census redistricting data (p.l. 94-171) noisy measurement file includes zero-concentrated differentially private (zcdp) (bun, m. and steinke, t [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete gaussian mechanism. these are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2020 census edited file (cef), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2020 census of population and housing. the noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the topdown algorithm (tda) to produce the 2020 census redistricting data (p.l. 94-171) summary file . the nmf ... details → usage examples the 2020 census disclosure avoidance system topdown algorithm by abowd, j., ashmead, r., cumings-menon, r., garfinkel, s., heineck, m., heiss, c., johns, r., kifer, d., leclerc, p., machanavajjhala, a., moran, b., sexton, w., spence, m., zhuravlev, p. geographic spines in the 2020 census disclosure avoidance system by abowd, j., ashmead, r., cumings-menon, r., garfinkel, s., heineck, m., heiss, c., johns, r., kifer, d., leclerc, p., machanavajjhala, a., moran, b., sexton, w., spence, m., zhuravlev, p. see 2 usage examples → 4d nucleome (4dn) bioinformatics biology genetic genomic imaging life sciences the goal of the national institutes of health (nih) common fundâs 4d nucleome (4dn) program is to study the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus in space and time (the 4th dimension). the nucleus of a cell contains dna, the genetic âblueprintâ that encodes all of
