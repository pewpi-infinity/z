machine learning neurobiology this dataset consists of images of glioblastoma human brain tumor tissue sections that have been probed for expression of particular genes believed to play a role in development of the cancer. each tissue section is adjacent to another section that was stained with a reagent useful for identifying histological features of the tumor. each of these types of images has been completely annotated for tumor features by a machine learning process trained by expert medical doctors. details → usage examples accessing ivy glioblastoma atlas project data by allen

cellular resolution gene expression profiles using in situ hybridization (ish). highly methodical data production methods and comprehensive anatomical coverage via dense, uniformly spaced sampling facilitate data consistency and comparability across >20,000 genes. the use of an inbred mouse strain with minimal animal-to-animal variance allows one to treat the brain essentially as a complex but highly reproducible three-dimensional tissue array. the entire allen mouse brain atlas dataset and associated tools are available through an... details → usage examples allen mouse brain atlas by
