marine water data released from projects funded by the department of energy's water power technologies office (doe wpto) that are too large or complex to be conveniently accessed by traditional means. the marine energy data lake aims to improve and automate access of high-value mhk data sets, making data actionable and discoverable by researchers and industry to accelerate analysis and advance innovation. this data lake is a sister-data lake to the department of energyâs open energy data initiative (oedi) data lake. details → district of columbia - classified point cloud lidar cities disaster response geospatial us-dc lidar point cloud data for washington, dc is available for anyone to use on amazon s3. this dataset, managed by the office of the chief technology officer (octo), through the direction of the district of columbia gis program, contains tiled point cloud data for the entire district along with associated metadata. details → enhance.pet 1.6k - whole-/total-body

hourly outputs from the weather research and forecasting (wrf) model generated by the epa's office of state air partnerships (osap), air quality assessment division, air quality modeling branch. these data were generated at a 12-km resolution over the continental united states (12us), beginning for the year 2021 and continuing annually through 2023. these files are intended for use in a broad range of air quality applications, but specifically may be used in dispersion modeling applications that would benefit from the use of the mesoscale model interface (mmif) tool ( https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling-related-model-support-programs#mmif ) which... details → epa risk-screening environmental indicators environmental detailed air model results

square kilometer array (ska) precursor in western australia. this particular dataset is from the epoch of reionization project which is a key science driver of the ska. nearly 2pb of such observations have been recorded to date, this is a small subset of that which has been exported from the mwa data archive in perth and made available to the public on aws. the data were taken to detect signatures of the first stars and galaxies forming and the effect of these early stars and galaxies on the evolution of the u... details → gatk test data bioinformatics biology cancer genetic genomic life
