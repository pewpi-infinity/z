[ real-time rrfs output will cease to be generated for several months beginning on ~3 december 2024. this step is being taken to allow for final retrospective testing to be completed. ] it is not under 24x7 monitoring and is not operational. output may be delayed or missing. outputs will change. when significant changes to output take place, this description will be updated. we currently provide hourly deterministic forecasts at 3 km grid spacing out to 60 hours at 00, 06, 12, and 18 utc, and out to 18 hours for other cycles. output is organized by cycle date and cycle hour.for example, rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20241201/12/control contains the deterministic forecast initialized at 12 utc on 01 december 2024. users will find two types of output in grib2 format. the first is: rrfs.t12z.natlev.f018.grib2 meaning that this is the rrfs_a initialized at 12 utc, covers the full north america domain, and is the native level post-processed gridded data at hour 18. this output is on a rotated latitude-longitude grid at 3 km grid spacing. the second output file in grib2 format is: rrfs.t12z.prslev.f018.conus.grib2 the âprslevâ descriptor indicates that this post-processed gridded data is output on pressure levels. the âconusâ descriptor indicates that it covers the contiguous united statesfor users interested in other domains, output is provided on the full 3-km north american grid and also subset over
