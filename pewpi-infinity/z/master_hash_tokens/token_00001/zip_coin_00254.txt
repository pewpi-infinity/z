generation amazon.science commerce natural language processing this dataset provides a set of non-shoppable items, which are items that can't be purchased via a virtual assistant (love, vampires, etc). in addition, for each non-shoppable item, the dataset contains humorous responses generated by two different large language models, and a template-based generation solution that uses a commonsense knowledge graph called conceptnet. finally, each row contains a score provided by human annotators that judge how funny each response is. the columns provided for each datapoint are as follows: question- purchase request of the non-shoppable item answer- a ge... details → usage examples evaluating humorous response generation to playful shopping requests by natalie shapira, oren
