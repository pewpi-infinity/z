first challenge on fully automated assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils) in breast cancer histopathology slides. tils are proving to be an important biomarker in cancer patients as they can play a part in killing tumor cells, particularly in some types of breast cancer. identifying and measuring tils can help to better target treatments, particularly immunotherapy, and may result in lower levels of other more aggressive treatments, including chemo... details → usage examples whole slide data - python package for working with wholeslide images and annotations files by diagnostic image analysis group, radboudumc, nijmegen tiger challenge by diagnostic image analysis group, radboudumc, nijmegen see 2 usage examples → tabula sapiens biology encyclopedic genetic genomic health life sciences medicine single-cell transcriptomics tabula sapiens is a benchmark, first-draft human cell atlas of over 1.1m cells from 28 organs of 24 normal human subjects. this work is the product of the tabula sapiens consortium. taking the organs from the same individual controls for genetic background, age, environment, and epigenetic effects, and allows detailed analysis and comparison of cell types that are shared between tissues. our work creates a detailed portrait of cell types as well as their distribution and variation in gene expression across tissues and within the endothelial, epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. we... details → usage examples the tabula sapiens: a multiple organ single cell transcriptomic atlas of humans by the tabula sapiens consortium tabula sapiens reveals transcription factor expression, senescence effects, and sex-specific features in cell types from 28 human organs and tissues by the tabula sapiens consortium, stephen r quake see 2 usage examples → terra fusion data sampler geospatial satellite imagery the terra basic fusion dataset is a fused dataset of the original level 1 radiances from the five terra instruments. they have been fully validate to contain the original terra instrument level 1 data. each level 1 terra basic fusion file contains one full terra orbit of data and is typically 15 â 40 gb in size, depending on how much data was collected for that orbit. it contains instrument radiance in physical units; radiance quality indicator; geolocation for each ifov at its native resolution; sun-view geometry; bservation time; and other attributes/metadata. it is stored in hdf5, conformed to cf conventions, and accessible by netcdf-4 enhanced models. itâs naming convention follows: terra_bf_l1b_oxxxx_yyyymmddhhmmss_f000_v000.h5. a concise description of the dataset, along with links to complete documentation and available software tools, can be found on the terra fusion project page: https://terrafusion.web.illinois.edu . terra is the flagship satellite of nasaâs earth observing system (eos). it was launched into orbit on december 18, 1999 and carries five instruments. these are the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis), the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (misr), the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (aster), the clouds and earthâs radiant energy system (ceres), and the measurements of pollution in the troposphere (mopitt). the terra basic fusion dataset is an easy-to-access record of the level 1 radiances for instruments on... details → usage examples terrafusion github by university of illinois basic terra fusion product algorithm theoretical basis and data specifications by zhao, guangu;
