where it is seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been observed by satellite. they are generated using the wofs classification algorithm on landsat satellite data. there are several wofs products available for the african continent including scene-level dat... details → usage examples analysing effects of drought on inundation extent and vegetation cover dynamics in the okavango delta by kelebogile mfundisi, kenneth mubea, fang yuan, chad burton and edward boamah water observations from space: accurate maps of surface water through time for the continent of africa by meghan halabisky, kenneth mubea, fatou mar, fang yuan, chad burton, eloise birchall, negin f. moghaddam, sena ghislain adimou, bako mamane, david ongo, edward boamah, ee-faye chong, nikita gandhi, alex leith, lisa hall and adam lewis digital earth africa geoportal by digital earth africa contributors digital earth africa notebook repo by digital earth africa contributors digital earth africa web services by digital earth africa contributors see 11 usage examples → international neuroimaging data-sharing initiative (indi) homo sapiens imaging life sciences magnetic resonance imaging neuroimaging neuroscience this bucket contains multiple neuroimaging datasets that are part of the international neuroimaging data-sharing initiative. raw human and non-human primate neuroimaging data include 1) structural mri;
