repository within the activ trace initiative houses a comprehensive collection of datasets related to sars-cov-2. the processing of sars-cov-2 sequence read archive (sra) files has been optimized to identify genetic variations in viral samples. this information is then presented in the variant call format (vcf). each vcf file corresponds to the sra parent-run's accession id. additionally, the data is available in the parquet format, making it easier to search and filter using the amazon athena service. the sars-cov-2 variant calling pipeline is designed to handle new data every six ho...

downscaling dataset climate coastal disaster response environmental meteorological oceans sustainability water weather the university of wisconsin probabilistic downscaling (uwpd) is a statistically downscaled dataset based on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (cmip5) climate models. uwpd consists of three variables, daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature. the spatial resolution is 0.1 ° x0.1 ° degree resolution for the united states and southern canada east of the rocky mountains. the downscaling methodology is not deterministic. instead, to properly capture unexplained variability and extreme events, the methodology predicts a spatially and temporally varying probability density function (pdf) for each variable. statistics such as the mean, mean pdf and annual maximum statistics can be calculated directly from the daily pdf and these statistics are included in the dataset. in addition, âstandardâ, ârawâ data is created by randomly sampling from the pdfs to create a ârealizationâ of the local scale given the large-scale from the climate model. there are 3 realizations for temperature and 14 realizations for precipitation.

and ions at low earth orbit. these precipitating particles are of interest for space weather operations and research, in part because they produce aurora during normal and very strong geomagnetic storms. this dataset contains both sensor-level raw data (as detailed in redmon et al. 2017) and a high-level machine-learning-ready data product. details → usage examples ssj_latbin: create and read
