common data form (netcdf), which is a very common format used across the scientific community. these particular gfs files contain a comprehensive number of global atmosphere/land variables at a relatively high spatiotemporal resolution (approximately 13x13 km horizontal, vertical resolution of 127 levels, and hourly), are not only necessary for the nacc-cloud tool to adequately drive community air quality applications (e.g., u.s. epaâs community multiscale air quality model; https://www.epa.gov/cmaq ), but can be very useful for a myriad of other applications in the earth system modeling communities (e.g., atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, etc.). while many other data file and record formats are indeed available for earth system and climate research (e.g., grib, hdf, geotiff), the netcdf files here are advantageous to the larger community because of the comprehensive, high spatiotemporal information they contain, and because they are more scalable, appendable, shareable, self-describing, and community-friendly (i.e., many tools available to the community of users). out of the four operational gfs forecast cycles per day (at 00z, 06z, 12z and 18z) this particular netcdf dataset is updated daily (/inputs/yyyymmdd/) for the 12z cycle and includes 24-hr output for both 2d (gfs.t12z.sfcf$0hh.nc) and 3d variables (gfs.t12z.atmf$0hh.nc). also available are netcdf formatted global land surface datasets (glsds) developed by hung et al . (2024). the glsds are based on numerous satellite products, and have been gridded to match the gfs spatial resolution (~13x13 km). these glsds contain vegetation canopy data (e.g., land surface type, vegetation clumping index, leaf area index, vegetative canopy height, and green vegetation fraction) that are supplemental to and can be combined with the gfs meteorological netcdf data for various applications, including noaa-arl's canopy-app . the canop... details → usage examples u.s. epaâs application of noaaâs gfs netcdf data on aws and nacc-cloud: 'expedited modeling of burn events results (ember): a screening-level dataset of 2023 ozone fire impacts in the us.' by simon et al. noaaâs global forecast system data in the cloud for community air quality modeling. atmosphere 2023, 14, 1110. by campbell, p.c.;
