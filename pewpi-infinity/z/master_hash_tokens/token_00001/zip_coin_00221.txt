labeled life sciences machine learning medical image computing medical imaging radiology x-ray tomography blunt force abdominal trauma is among the most common types of traumatic injury, with the most frequent cause being motor vehicle accidents. abdominal trauma may result in damage and internal bleeding of the internal organs, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bowel. detection and classification of injuries are key to effective treatment and favorable outcomes. a large proportion of patients with abdominal trauma require urgent surgery. abdominal trauma often cannot be diagnosed clinically by physical exam, patient symptoms, or laboratory tests. prompt diagnosis of abdominal trauma using... details → usage examples the rsna abdominal traumatic injury ct (ratic)

image computing medical imaging radiology x-ray tomography over 1.5 million spine fractures occur annually in the united states alone resulting in over 17,730 spinal cord injuries annually. the most common site of spine fracture is the cervical spine. there has been a rise in the incidence of spinal fractures in the elderly and in this population, fractures can be more difficult to detect on imaging due to degenerative disease and osteoporosis. imaging diagnosis of adult spine fractures is now almost exclusively performed with computed tomography (ct). quickly detecting and determining the location of any vertebral fractures is essential to prevent ne... details → usage examples the rsna cervical spine fracture ct dataset by ming, hui lin see 1 usage example → rsna intracranial

intracranial aneurysm detection (rsna-ica) dataset is a collection of over 4,000 ct brain scans annotated by a cohort of over 40 volunteer radiologists from rsna and the american society of neuroradiology to show the presence and location of intracranial aneurysms. it also includes a set of about 200 imaging studies that are annotated with ai-generated segmentations highlighting abnormalities. the imaging data was provided by 18 institutions. initially compiled in 2025 for the rsna intracranial aneurysm detection ai challenge hosted on kaggle competiti... details → usage
