european space agency (esa) mission with involvement by nasa. the primary science goals of euclid are to better understand the composition and evolution of the dark universe. the euclid mission will provide space-based imaging and spectroscopy as well as supporting ground-based imaging to achieve these primary goals. these data will be archived by multiple global repositories, including irsa, where they will support transformational work in many areas of astrophysics. euclid quick release 1 (q1) consists of ~30 tb of imaging, spectroscopy, and catalogs coverin... details → usage examples

humidity precipitation visibility weather wind speeds zarr a zarr-formatted dataset of 1836 reforecast cases (approx. 5 years) from the weather company graf (global high-resolution atmospheric forecasting) model, a version of the national center for atmospheric research (ncar) model for predictions across scales (mpas). graf is global, but the configuration for this reforecast had a mesh refinement to approx. 4 km over the us, caribbean basin, and europe, and 15 km elsewhere. this model was designed to run much of its computation on graphical processing units, with this development assisted by nvidia. the 1836 cases (approx. 5 years) were generated fr... details → usage examples global reforecasts from mpas âgrafâ with mesh refinement over the us and europe by thomas m.

astronomy gaia dr3 data were originally released by the european space agency in december 2020. this hats -formatted catalog was produced by the lsst interdisciplinary network for collaboration and computing. the gaia hats datasets are specifically designed for efficient spatial cross-matching with other hats-format catalogs, whether within the same archive or across distributed archive data centers. this enables astronomers to perform complex analyses, such as identifying correlations or overlaps between datasets from different surveys. users can leverage lsdb (large-scale database) , a scalable spatial ... details → usage examples dark energy survey / gaia dr3 crossmatch by lsdb collaboration see 1 usage example → global carbon budget data climate land oceans the global carbon
