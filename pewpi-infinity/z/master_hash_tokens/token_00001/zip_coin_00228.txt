genome cross-species aligner) to detect contamination from foreign organisms in genome sequences. details → galaxy evolution explorer satellite (galex) astronomy the galaxy evolution explorer satellite (galex) was a nasa mission led by the california institute of technology, whose primary goal was to investigate how star formation in galaxies evolved from the early universe up to the present. galex used microchannel plate detectors to obtain direct images in the near-uv (nuv) and far-uv (fuv), and a grism to disperse light for low resolution spectroscopy. details → genome ark biodiversity bioinformatics biology conservation genetic genomic life sciences the genome ark hosts genomic information for the vertebrate genomes project (vgp) and other related projects. the vgp is an international collaboration that aims to generate complete and near error-free reference genomes for all extant vertebrate species. these genomes will be used to address fundamental questions in biology and disease, to identify species most genetically at risk for extinction, and to preserve genetic information of life. details → google satellite embedding v1 aerial imagery earth observation imaging machine learning satellite imagery cog (cloud-optimized geotiff) files that together contain the alphaearth foundations annual satellite embedding dataset. it contains the annual embeddings for the years from 2018 to 2024, inclusive. details → gretel synthetic safety alignment dataset ai safety machine learning natural language processing synthetic data a comprehensive dataset designed for aligning language models with safety and ethical guidelines. contains 8,361 curated triplets of prompts, responses, and safe responses across various risk categories. each entry includes safety scores, judge reasoning, and harm probability assessments, making it valuable for model alignment, testing, and benchmarking. details → usage examples building datasets to enable safer ai responses by gretel.ai gretel navigator data designer by gretel.ai getting started with the gretel safety alignment dataset by gretel.ai see 3 usage examples → grid algorithms and data analytics library (gadal) energy environmental model sustainability the aim of this project is to create an easy-to-use platform where various types of analytics can be performed on a wide range of electrical grid datasets. the aim is to establish an open-source library of algorithms that universities, national labs and other developers can contribute to which can be used on both open-source and proprietary grid data to improve the analysis of electrical distribution systems for the grid modeling community. oedi systems integration (si) is a grid algorithms and data analytics api created to standardize how data is sent between different modules that are run as... details → gulfwide avian colony monitoring survey photos biology conservation ecosystems environmental labeled object detection for this project, the water institute (the institute) and subcontractor colibri ecological consulting, llc (colibri) utilized established methods and protocols capable of assessing changes of colonial waterbird populations and their important habitats within individual states and the broader northern gulf of mexico region. data collection activities included: aerial photographic nest surveys: implementation of fixed-wing aircraft surveys intended to assess waterbird colonies and document associated nesting within select portions of the northern gulf of mexico. additional detail is provide... details → guy's breast cancer lymph nodes (grape) biology breast cancer cancer computational pathology histopathology life sciences this is a retrospective dataset of 1523 h&e-stained whole slide images (wsi) of lymph nodes from breast cancer patients. the cohort consisted of 177 patients (122 ln-positive - metastasis was reported in at least 1 ln - and 55 ln-negative patients) with invasive breast carcinoma treated between 1984 and 2002 at guyâs hospital london, uk. slides were scanned and digitised at 40x magnification (0.23 âµm/pixel), nanozoomer h.t2.0 2.0-ht (hamamatsu photonics uk, ltd, welwyn garden city, uk). wsis are in .ndpi format. details → hirlam weather model agriculture climate earth observation meteorological weather hirlam (high resolution limited area model) is an operational synoptic and mesoscale weather prediction model managed by the finnish meteorological institute. details → high resolution downscaled climate data for southeast alaska agriculture climate coastal earth observation environmental sustainability weather this dataset contains historical and projected dynamically downscaled climate data for the southeast region of the state of alaska at 1 and 4km spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution. select variables are also summarized into daily resolutions. this data was produced using the weather research and forecasting (wrf) model (version 4.0). we downscaled both climate forecast system reanalysis (cfsr) historical reanalysis data (1980-2019) and both historical and projected runs from two gcmâs from the coupled model inter-comparison project 5 (cmip5): gfdl-cm3 and ncar-ccsm4 (historical ru... details → homeland security and infrastructure us cities disaster response elevation geospatial lidar the u.s. cities elevation data collection program supported the us department of homeland security homeland security and infrastructure program (hsip). as part of the hsip program, there were 133+ u.s. cities that had imagery and lidar collected to provide the homeland security, homeland defense, and emergency preparedness, response and recovery (epr&r) community with common operational, geospatially enabled baseline data needed to analyze threat, support critical infrastructure protection and expedite readiness, response and recovery in the event of a man-made or natural disaster. as a pa... details → hubble space telescope astronomy the hubble space telescope (hst) is one of the most productive scientific instruments ever created. this dataset contains calibrated and raw data for all currently active instruments on hst: acs, cos, stis, wfc3, and fgs. details → hybrid statistical-dynamic downscaling based on multi-model ensembles in southeast asia climate netcdf precipitation gcms under cmip6 have been widely used to investigate climate change impacts and put forward associated adaptation and mitigation strategies. however, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions (usually 100~300km) preclude their direct applications
