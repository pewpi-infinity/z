validated product contains static radar geometry layers associated with the opera coregistered single-look complex (cslc) from sentinel-1 (s1) validated product. due to the s1 missionâs narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are considered static. these static layers are provided separately from the opera cslc-s1

sentinel-1 (dswx-s1) product version 1. dswx-s1 provides near-global geographical mapping of surface water extent over land at a spatial resolution of 30 meters over the military grid reference system (mgrs) grid system, with a temporal revisit frequency between 6-12 days. using sentinel-1 radar observations, dswx-s1 maps open inland water bodies greater than 3 hectares and 200 meters in width, irrespective of cloud conditions and daylight illumination that often pose challenges to optical sensors. forward production of the... details → usage examples generate flood maps without downloading

harmonized landsat sentinel-2 product (version 1) cog earth observation environmental global land land cover land use satellite imagery the observational products for end-users from remote sensing analysis ( opera ) land surface disturbance alert from harmonized landsat sentinel-2 (hls) product version 1 maps vegetation disturbance alerts that are derived from data collected by landsat 8 and landsat 9 operational land imager (oli) and sentinel-2a, sentinel-2b, and sentinel-2c multi-spectral instrument (msi). a vegetation disturbance alert is detected at 30 meter (m) spatial resolution when there is an indicated decrease in vegetation cover within an hls pixel. the level-3 data product also provides additional information about more general disturbance trends and auxiliary generic disturbance information as determined from the variations of the reflectance through the hls scenes. hls data represent the highest temporal frequency data available at medium spatial resolution. the combined observations will provide greater sensitivity to land changes, whether of large magnitude/short duration or small magnitude/long duration.the opera_l3_dist-alert-hls (or dist-alert) data
