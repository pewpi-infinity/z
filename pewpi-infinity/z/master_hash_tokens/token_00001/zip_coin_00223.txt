encyclopedic genomic health life sciences medicine tabula muris is a compendium of single cell transcriptomic data from the model organism mus musculus comprising more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. these data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations, and allow for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as t-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3â-end counting, enabled the s... details → usage examples single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a tabula muris. by tabula muris consortium

transcriptomic data from the model organism mus musculus comprising more than 500,000 cells from 18 organs and tissues across the mouse lifespan. we discovered cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. using single-cell transcriptomic data we were able to assess cell type specific manifestations of different hallmarks of aging, such as senescence, changes in the activity of metabolic pathways, depletion of stem-cell populat... details → usage examples fast queries of scrnaseq

(ukb) and thirteen biopharmaceutical companies characterising the plasma proteomic profiles of 54,219 ukb participants. as part of a collaborative analysis across the thirteen ukb-ppp partners, we conducted comprehensive protein quantitative trait loci (pqtl) mapping of 2,923 proteins that identifies 14,287 primary genetic associations, of which 85% are newly discovered, in addition to ancestry-specific pqtl mapping in non-europeans. we identify independent secondary associations in 87% of cis and 30% of trans loci, expanding the catalogue ... details → usage examples plasma

survey explorer (unwise) astronomy object detection parquet survey unwise is a reprocessing of wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) data which preserves the native angular resolution and is optimized for forced photometry. wise was a nasa satellite producing all-sky imaging in four infrared bands centered at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns (w1, w2, w3, and w4) starting in 2010 until the coolant was exhausted in 2011. it was reactivated in 2013 as neowise and continued imaging in w1 and w2 until 2024. details → usage examples notebook tutorials by caltech/ipac-irsa see 1 usage example

identification speech processing voices is a speech corpus recorded in acoustically challenging settings, using distant microphone recording. speech was recorded in real rooms with various acoustic features (reverb, echo, hvac systems, outside noise, etc.). adversarial noise, either television, music, or babble, was concurrently played with clean speech. data was recorded using multiple microphones strategically placed throughout the room. the corpus includes audio recordings, orthographic transcriptions, and speaker labels. details → usage examples getting started with voices data
