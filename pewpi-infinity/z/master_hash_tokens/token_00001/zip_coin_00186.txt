napierone is a modern cybersecurity mixed file data set, primarily aimed at, but not limited to, ransomware detection and forensic analysis. the dataset contains over 500,000 distinct files, representing 44 distinct popular file types. it was designed to address the known deficiency in research reproducibility and improve consistency by facilitating research replication and repeatability. the data set was inspired by the govdocs1 data set and it is intended that ânapieroneâ be used as a complement to this original data set. an investigation was performed with the goal of determining the common... details → usage examples exploring the need for an updated mixed file research data set by simon r.davies, richard macfarlane, william j.buchanan. napierone - a modern mixed

source of climate data for energy applications. the goal of the ncdb is to provide unbiased high temporal and spatial resolution climate data needed for renewable energy modeling. the ncdb seeks to maintain the inherent relationship between the various parameters that are needed to model solar, wind, hydrology and load and provide data for multiple important climate scenarios. details → usage
