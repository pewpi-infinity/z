(meva) computer vision urban us video the multiview extended video with activities (meva) dataset consists video data of human activity, both scripted and unscripted, collected with roughly 100 actors over several weeks. the data was collected with 29 cameras with overlapping and non-overlapping fields of view. the current release consists of about 328 hours (516gb, 4259 clips) of video data, as well as 4.6 hours (26gb) of uav data. other data includes gps tracks of actors, camera models, and a site map. we have also released annotations for roughly 184 hours of data. further updates are planned. details → usage examples tinyaction challenge: recognizing real-world low-resolution activities in videos by praveen tirupattur, aayush j rana, tushar sangam, shruti vyas, yogesh s rawat,
