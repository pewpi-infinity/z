48 inch schmidt telescope and a custom-built wide-field camera to image the night sky in three photometric filters (g, r, and i). it is a fully-automated survey aimed at a systematic exploration of optical transient phenomena. it completes a scan of the observable northern sky approximately every three nights. details → usage examples multi-wavelength light curves tutorial by fornax initiative

survey explorer (wise) was a nasa medium explorer satellite in low-earth orbit that conducted an all-sky astronomical imaging survey over four infrared bands from 2010-2011. the 3-band cryo data release contains 3.4, 4.6 and 12 micron (w1, w2, w3) imaging data that were acquired between 6 aug and 29 sept 2010 while the detectors were cooled by the inner cryogen tank following the exhaustion of the outer tank. details → usage examples notebook tutorials by caltech/ipac-irsa see 1 usage example → 3dcompat: composition of materials on parts of 3d things computer vision machine learning 3d compat is a richly annotated large-scale dataset of rendered compositions of materials on parts of thousands of unique 3d models. this dataset primarily focuses on stylizing 3d shapes at part-level with compatible materials. each object with the applied part-material compositions is rendered from four equally spaced views as well as four randomized views. we introduce a new task, called grounded compat recognition (gcr), to collectively recognize and ground compositions of materials on parts of 3d objects. we present two variations of this task and adapt state-of-art 2d/3d deep learning

of the dsm caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (srf) of about 1% of the width of the srf, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. this shift is reflected in the âspectral_freqâ parameter (observed frequencies) in the l1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. the magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (bt) depends
