an instantaneous 3-dimensional 3-hourly data collection in modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 (merra-2). this collection consists of assimilations of meteorological parameters at 42 pressure levels, such as temperature, wind components, vertical pressure velocity, water vapor, ozone mass mixing ratio, and layer height. the data field is available every three hours starting from 00:00 utc, e.g.: 00:00, 03:00, â¦ , 21:00 utc. the information on the pressure levels can be found in the section 4.2 of the merra-2 file specification document. merra-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by nasa global modeling and assimilation office (gmao) using the goddard earth observing system model (geos) version 5.12.4. the dataset covers the period of 1980-present with the latency of ~3 weeks after the end of a month. data reprocessing: please check ârecords of merra-2 data reprocessing and
