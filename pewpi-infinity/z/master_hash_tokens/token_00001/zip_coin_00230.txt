however, derived results from icesat-2 shows promising results for improving the accuracy of the bathymetry information in the nearshore region. project overview one of ngaâs and noaaâs primary missions is to provide safety of navigation information. however, coastal depth information is still lacking in some regionsâspecifically, remote regions. in fact, it has been reported that 80 percent of the entire seafloor has not been mapped. traditionally, airborne lidars and survey boats are used to map the seafloor, but in remote areas, we have to rely on satellite capabilities, which currently lack the vertical accuracy desired to support safety of navigation in shallow water. in 2018, nasa launched a space-based lidar system called icesat-2 that has global coverage and a polar orbit originally designed to monitor the ice elevation in polar regions. remarkably, because it has a green laser beam, icesat-2 also happens to collect bathymetry information icesat-2 . with algorithm development provided by university of texas (ut) austin, nga research and development (r&d) leveraged the icesat-2 platform to generate scuba, an automated depth retrieval algorithm for accurate, global, refraction-corrected underwater depths from 0 m to 30 m, detailed in figure 1 of the documentation. the key benefit of this product is the vertical depth accuracy of depth retrievals, which is ideal for a calibration tool. nga and noaa national geodetic survey (ngs), partnered to make this product available to the public for all us territories. ... details → noaa 3-d surge and tide operational forecast system for the atlantic basin (stofs-3d-atlantic) climate coastal disaster response environmental global marine navigation meteorological oceans sustainability water weather notice - the coast survey development laboratory (csdl) in noaa/national ocean service (nos)/office of coast survey is upgrading the surge and tide operational forecast system (stofs, formerly estofs) to version 2.1. a service change notice (scn) has been issued and can be found " here " noaa's surge and tide operational forecast system: three-dimensional component for the atlantic basin (stofs-3d-atlantic). stofs-3d-atlantic runs daily (at 12 utc) to provide users with 24-hour nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and up to 96-hour forecast guidance of water level conditions, and 2- and 3-dimensional fields of water temperature, salinity, and currents. the water levelâ outputs represent the combined tidal and subtidal water surface elevations and are referenced to xgeoid20b stofs-3d-atlantic has been developed to serve the marine navigation, weather forecasting, and disaster mitigation user communities. it is developed in a collaborative effort between the noaa/national ocean service (nos)/office of coast survey, the noaa/national weather service (nws)/national centers for environmental prediction (ncep) central operations (nco), and the virginia institute of marine science. stofs-3d-atlantic employs the semi-implicit cross-scale hydroscience integrated system model (schism) as the hydrodynamic model core. its unstructured grid consists of 2,926,236 nodes and 5,654,157 triangular or quadrilateral elements. grid resolution is 1.5-2 km near the shoreline, ~600 m for the floodplain, down to 8 m
