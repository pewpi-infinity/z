nclimgrid are gridded observed historical climatology data that were used in the loca2 and star-esdm downscaling process of global climate models as part of the 5th national climate assessment. the original livneh and nclimgrid daily temperature and precipitation observations have been converted to a series of decision-relevant thresholds as part of the (u.s. climate resilience information system (cris)) . these thresholds, such as days with extreme heat or precipitation, have been calculated to match the future projections from loca2 and star, also available in cris. details → usage

is to make meteorological and oceanic measurements from autonomous platforms. calibrated, quality-controlled, and well-documented climatological measurements are available on the ocs webpage and the oceansites global data assembly centers (gdacs), with near-realtime data available prior to release of the complete, downloaded datasets. ocs measurements served through the big data program come from ocs high-latitude moored buoys located in the kuroshio extension (32â°n 145â°e) and the gulf of alaska (50â°n 145â°w). initiated in 2004 and 20 ... details → usage examples ocs publications - all

aerial imagery cog earth observation geospatial imaging mapping the new jersey office of gis, nj office of information technology manages a series of 11 digital orthophotography and scanned aerial photo maps collected at various years ranging from 1930 to 2017. each yearâs worth of imagery are available as cloud optimized geotiff (cog) files and some years are available as compressed mrsid and/or jp2 files. additionally, each year of imagery is organized into a tile grid scheme covering the entire geography of new jersey. many years share the same tiling grid while others have unique grids as defined by the project at the time. details → usage examples visualize imagery changes by stephanie.bosits@tech.nj.gov see 1 usage example → new jersey statewide lidar elevation geospatial lidar mapping elevation datasets in new jersey have been collected over several years as several discrete projects. each project covers a geographic area, which is a subsection of the entire state,
