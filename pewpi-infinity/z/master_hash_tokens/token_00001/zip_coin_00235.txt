era5 for atmospheric data and oras5 for ocean and ice dynamics. each simulation stream was initialized from these reanalyses, which were pre-processed for the ufs model components, including the gfdl finite-volume cubed-sphere dynamical core (fv3; 25 km, 127 vertical levels) and the modular ocean model (mom6; â¼ degree tri-polar grid, 72 vertical levels). this replay methodology enforces a predetermined model state while allowing cross-component fluxes and unconstrained processes to be computed. for the land surface, noaaâs jedi-based land data assimilation system incorporated snow depth observations from the ncei global historical climatology network (ghcn) and satellite-derived snow cover from the u.s. national ice center. the jedi sea-ice ocean and coupled analysis system (soca) adjusted sea-ice thickness and concentration for consistency with oras5. the original dataset spanned january 1994 to october 2023, with plans for ongoing updates and a 1-degree version covering 1958 to 2023. the dataset is hosted on aws and gcp clou ... details → noaa unified forecast system (ufs) hierarchical testing framework (htf) agriculture climate disaster response environmental meteorological oceans weather the " unified forecast system " (ufs) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive earth modeling system. the hierarchical testing framework (htf) serves as a comprehensive toolkit designed to enhance the testing capabilities within ufs " repositories ". it aims to standardize and simplify the testing process across various " ufs weather model " (wm) components and associated modules, aligning with the hierarchical system development (hsd) approach and noaa baseline operational metrics. the htf provides a structured methodology for test case design and execution, which enhances code management practices, fosters user accessibility, and promotes adherence to established testing protocols. it enables developers to conduct testing efficiently and consistently, ensuring code integrity and reliability through the use of established technologies such as cmake and ctest. when integrated with containerization techniques, the htf facilitates portability of test cases and promotes reproducibility across different computing environments. this approach reduces the computational overhead and enhances collaboration within the ufs community by providing a unified testing framework. acknowledgment - the unified forecast system (ufs) atmosphere-ocean coupled model... details → noaa unified forecast system (ufs) land data assimilation (da) system agriculture climate meteorological weather the unified forecast system (ufs) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive earth modeling system. it supports " multiple applications " covering different forecast durations and spatial domains. the land data assimilation (da) system is an offline version of the noah multi-physics (noah-mp) land surface model (lsm) used in the ufs weather model (wm). its data assimilation framework uses "[joint effort for data assimilation integration - jedi] ( https://www.jcsda.org/jcsda-project-jedi)" software. the offline noah-mp lsm is a stand-alone, uncoupled model used to execute land surface simulations. in this traditional uncoupled mode, near-surface atmospheric forcing data is required as input. sample forcing and restart data are provided in this data bucket. the noah-mp lsm has evolved through community efforts to pursue and refine a modern-era lsm suitable for use in the national centers for environmental prediction (ncep) operational weather and climate prediction models. this collaborative effort continues with participation from entities such as ncar, ncep, nasa, and university groups. for details regarding the physical parameterizations used in noah-mp, see "[niu, et al.
