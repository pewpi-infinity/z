at regional scales, which are exactly where the analysis (e.g., hydrological model simulation) is performed. to bridge this gap, a typical approach is to ârefineâ the information from gcms through regional climate downscaling experiments, which can be conducted statistically, dynamically, or a combination thereof. statistical downscaling establishes ... details → iserv earth observation environmental geospatial satellite imagery iss servir environmental research and visualization system (iserv) was a fully-automated prototype camera aboard the international space station that was tasked to capture high-resolution earth imagery of specific locations at 3-7 frames per second. in the course of its regular operations during 2013 and 2014, iserv's camera acquired images that can be used primaliry in use is environmental and disaster management. details → image localization - fast.ai datasets computer vision deep learning machine learning some of the most important datasets for image localization research, including camvid and pascal voc (2007 and 2012). this is part of the fast.ai datasets collection hosted by aws for convenience of fast.ai students. see documentation link for citation and license details for each dataset. details → inrad covid-19 x-ray and ct scans bioinformatics coronavirus covid-19 health life sciences medicine sars this dataset is a collection of anonymized thoracic radiographs (x-rays) and computed tomography (ct) scans of patients with suspected covid-19. images are acommpanied by a positive or negative diagnosis for sars-cov2 infection via rt-pcr. these images were provided by hospital das clã­nicas da universidade de sã£o paulo, hospital sirio-libanes, and by laboratory fleury. details → k2 mission data astronomy the k2 mission observed 100 square degrees for 80 days each across 20 different pointings along the ecliptic, collecting high-precision photometry for a selection of targets within each field. the mission began when the original kepler mission ended due to loss of the second reaction wheel in 2013. details → kitti vision benchmark suite autonomous vehicles computer vision deep learning machine learning robotics dataset and benchmarks for computer vision research in the context of autonomous driving. the dataset has been recorded in and around the city of karlsruhe, germany using the mobile platform annieway (vw station wagon) which has been equipped with several rgb and monochrome cameras, a velodyne hdl 64 laser scanner as well as an accurate rtk corrected gps/imu localization unit. the dataset has been created for computer vision and machine learning research on stereo, optical flow, visual odometry, semantic segmentation, semantic instance segmentation, road segmentation, single image depth

find transiting exoplanets, study variable stars, and find eclipsing binaries. details → mimic-iv clinical database demo the medical information mart for intensive care (mimic)-iv database is comprised of deidentified electronic health records for patients admitted to the beth israel deaconess medical center. access to mimic-iv is limited to credentialed users. here, we have provided an openly-available demo of mimic-iv containing a subset of 100 patients. the dataset includes similar content to mimic-iv, but excludes free-text clinical notes. the demo may be useful for running workshops and for assessing whether the mimic-iv is appropriate for a study before making an access r... details → mimic-iv-ecg: diagnostic electrocardiogram matched subset the mimic-iv-ecg module contains approximately 800,000 diagnostic electrocardiograms across nearly 160,000 unique patients. these diagnostic ecgs use 12 leads and are 10 seconds in length. they are sampled at 500 hz. this subset contains all of the ecgs for patients who appear in the mimic-iv clinical database. when a cardiologist report is available for a given ecg, we provide the needed information to link the waveform to the report. the patients in mimic-iv-ecg have been matched against the mimic-iv clinical database, making it possible to link to information across the mimic-iv modules. details → misr level 1b2 ellipsoid data v004 atmosphere climate cyclone typhoon hurricane datacenter earth observation global land opendap orbit mi1b2e_004 is the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (misr) level 1b2 ellipsoid data version 4 product. it contains ellipsoid-projected top-of-atmosphere (toa) radiance, resampled at the surface and topographically corrected, as well as geometrically corrected by pge22. data collection for this product is ongoing.misr itself is an instrument designed to view earth with cameras pointed in 9 different directions. as the instrument flies overhead, each piece of earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). the... details → megascenes benchmark computer vision deep learning internet the megascenes dataset is an extensive collection of around 430k scenes, featuring over 100k structure-from-motion reconstructions and over 2 million registered images. megascenes includes a diverse array of scenes, such as minarets, building interiors, statues, bridges, towers, religious buildings, and natural landscapes. the images of these scenes are captured under varying conditions, including different times of day, various weather and illumination, and from different devices with distinct camera intrinsics. details → usage examples megascenes: scene-level view synthesis at scale
