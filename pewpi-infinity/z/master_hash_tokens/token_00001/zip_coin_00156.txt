[2014] https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/papers/privacybook.pdf ) implemented via the discrete gaussian mechanism (cannone c., et al., [2023] https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010 ), which added positive or negative integer-valued noise to each of the resulting counts. the noisy measurements are an intermediate stage of the tda prior to the post-processing the tda then performs to ensure internal and hierarchical consistency within the resulting tables. the census bureau has released these 2010 census demonstration data to enable data users to evaluate the expected impact of disclosure avoidance variability on 2020 census data. the 2010 census production settings demographic and housing characteristics (dhc) demonstration noisy measurement file (2023-04-03) has been cleared for public dissemination by the census bureau disclosure review board (cbdrb-fy22-dsep-004). the 2010 census production settings demographic and housing characteristics demonstration noisy measurement file includes zero-concentrated differentially private (zcdp) (bun, m. and steinke, t [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete gaussian mechanism. these are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2010 census edited file (cef), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2010 census of population and housing. the noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the topdown algorithm (tda) to produce the 2010 census production settings privacy-protected microdata file - redistricting (p.l. 94-171) and
