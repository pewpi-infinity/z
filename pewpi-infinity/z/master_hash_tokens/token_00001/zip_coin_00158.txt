program to observe the interior of the ocean with a fleet of profiling floats drifting in the deep ocean currents ( https://argo.ucsd.edu ). argo gdac is a dataset of 5 billion in situ ocean observations from 18.000 profiling floats (4.000 active) which started 20 years ago. argo gdac dataset is a collection of 18.000 netcdf files. it is a major asset for ocean and climate science, a contributor to ioccp reports. details → usage examples outreach activities by argo program argo floats dashboard by euro-argo eric argo data selection by euro-argo eric argo data bibliography by argo

computer vision electron microscopy imaging life sciences microscopy segmentation the automated segmentation of intracellular substructures in electron microscopy (asem) project provides deep learning models trained to segment structures in 3d images of cells acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (fib-sem). each model is trained to detect a single type of structure (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, nuclear pores, clathrin-coated pits) in cells prepared via chemically-fixation (cf) or high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution (hpfs). you

computer vision deep learning grand-challenge.org histopathology life sciences "this dataset contains the all data for the cancer metastases in lymph nodes challenge or camelyon . camelyon was the first challenge using whole-slide images in computational pathology and aimed to help pathologists identify breast cancer metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. lymph node metastases are extremely important to find, as they indicate that the cancer is no longer localized and systemic treatment might be warranted. searching for these metastases in h&e-stained tissue is difficult and time-consuming and ai algorithms can play a role in helping make this faster and more accura... details → usage examples diagnostic assessment of deep learning algorithms for detection of lymph node
