proteome-scale effort to measure the localization and interactions of human proteins using high-throughput genome engineering to endogenously tag thousands of proteins in the human proteome. this dataset consists of the raw confocal fluorescence microscopy images for all tagged cell lines in the opencell library. these images can be interpreted both individually, to determine the localization of particular proteins of interest, and in aggregate, by training machine learning models to classify or quantify subcellular localization patterns. details → usage examples opencell: proteome-scale
