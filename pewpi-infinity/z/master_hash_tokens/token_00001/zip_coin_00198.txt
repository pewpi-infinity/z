e. a. m. heijnsdijk et al., 2018 ), it serves as a valuable biomarker for postprostatectomy follow-up in patients. following successful surgery, psa concentration is typically undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml) within 4-6 weeks ( s. s. goonewardene et al., 2014 ). however, approximately 30% of patients experience biochemical recurrence, signifying the resurgence of prostate cancer cells. this recurrence serves as a prognostic indicator for progression to clinical metastases and eventual prostate cancer-related mortality ( c. l. amling, 2014; â s. j. freedland et al., 2005; â m. han et al., 2001; â t. van den broeck et al., 2001 . current clinical practices gauge the risk of biochemical recurrence by considering the international society of urological pathology (isup) grade, psa value at diagnosis, and tnm staging criteria ( j. i. epstein et al., 2016 ). a recent european consensus guideline suggests categorizing patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups based on these factors ( n. mottet et al., 2021 ). notably, a high isup grade independently assigns a patient to the intermediate (grade 2/3) or high-risk group (grade 4/5). the gleason growth patterns, representing morphological patterns of prostate cancer, are used to categorize cancerous tissue into isup grade groups ( j. i. epstein, 2010; â p. m. pierorazio et al., 2013; g. j. l. h. van leenders et al., 2020; j. i. epstein et al., 2016 ). however, the isup grade has limitations, such as grading disagreement among pathologists ( j. i. epstein et al., 2016 ) and coarse descriptors of tissue morphology. recently, deep learning was shown ( h. pinckaers et al., 2022 ;
