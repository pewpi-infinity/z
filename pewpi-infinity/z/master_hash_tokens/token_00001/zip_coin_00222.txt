detection satellite imagery survey the spectro-photometer for the history of the universe, epoch of reionization, and ices explorer (spherex) is a nasa astrophysics medium-class explorer (midex) mission launched in march 2025. during its planned two-year mission, spherex will perform the first ever all-sky spectral survey in the optical to near-infrared (0.75-5 microns). spherex data will be used to probe inflation and the early universe, trace the history of galactic light production, and investigate the origin of planetary systems and biogenic ices, in addition to contributing to many other astrophysics research topics. irsa ... details → usage examples notebook tutorials by caltech/ipac-irsa see 1 usage example → safecast air quality climate environmental geospatial radiation an

alzheimer's disease brain cell atlas (sea-ad) biology cell biology cell imaging epigenomics gene expression histopathology homo sapiens imaging life sciences medicine microscopy neurobiology neuroscience single-cell transcriptomics transcriptomics the seattle alzheimer's disease brain cell atlas (sea-ad) consortium strives to gain a deep molecular and cellular understanding of the early pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease and is funded by the national institutes on aging (nia u19ag060909). the sea-ad datasets available here comprise single cell profiling (transcriptomics and epigenomics) and quantitative neuropathology. to explore gene expression and chromatin accessibility information, the single-cell profiling data includes: snrnaseq and snatac-seq data from the sea-ad

germany disaster response earth observation environmental geospatial satellite imagery sustainability synthetic aperture radar the sentinel1 single look complex (slc) unzipped dataset contains synthetic aperture radar (sar) data from the european space agencyâs sentinel-1 mission. different from the zipped data provided by esa, this dataset allows direct access to individual swaths required for a given study area, thus drastically minimizing the storage and downloading time requirements of a project. since the data is stored on s3, users can utilize the boto3 library and s3 get_object method to read the entire content of the object into the memory for processing, without actually having to download it. the sentinel-1 ... details → usage examples interferometric synthetic
