unrestricted mesoscale analysis (urma) agriculture climate meteorological weather the real-time mesoscale analysis (rtma) is a noaa national centers for environmental prediction (ncep) high-spatial and temporal resolution analysis/assimilation system for near-surf ace weather conditions. its main component is the ncep/emc gridpoint statistical interpolation (gsi) system applied in two-dimensional variational mode to assimilate conventional and satellite-derived observations. the rtma was developed to support ndfd operations and provide field forecasters with high quality analyses for nowcasting, situational awareness, and forecast verification purposes. the system produces ... details → noaa s-102 bathymetric surface data bathymetry hydrography marine navigation oceans seafloor water s-102 is a data and metadata encoding specification that is part of the s-100 universal hydrographic data model , an international standard for hydrographic data exchange. this collection of data contains bathymetric surfaces from noaa/nos/ocs national bathymetric source , for various u.s. coastal and offshore waters and the great lakes. these datasets are encoded as hdf5 files conforming to the s-102 specification. details → noaa severe weather data inventory (swdi) agriculture climate meteorological weather the storm events database is an integrated database of severe weather events across the united states from 1950 to this year, with information about a storm event's location, azimuth, distance, impact, and severity, including the cost of damages to property and crops. it contains data documenting: the occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce. rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in south florida or the s... details → noaa space weather follow-on mission geostationary operational environmental satellite (goes) 19 satellite imagery space weather the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) geostationary operational environmental satellite 19 (goes-19) is the fourth and final satellite in the geostationary operational environmental satellites (goes) â r series, the western hemisphereâs most sophisticated weather-observing and environmental monitoring system. the goes-r series provides advanced imagery and atmospheric measurements, real-time mapping of lightning activity, and space weather observations. as a part of the space weather follow on (swfo) mission, the goes-19 spacecraft contains a compact coronagraph-1 ( ... details → noaa space weather forecast and observation data climate meteorological solar weather space weather forecast and observation data is collected and disseminated by noaaâs space weather prediction center (swpc) in boulder, co. swpc produces forecasts for multiple space weather phenomenon types and the resulting impacts to earth and human activities. a variety of products are available that provide these forecast expectations, and their respective measurements, in formats that range from detailed technical forecast discussions to noaa scale values to simple bulletins that give information in laymen's terms. forecasting is the prediction of future events, based on analysis and... details → noaa terrestrial climate data records agriculture climate meteorological sustainability weather noaa's climate data records (cdrs) are robust, sustainable, and scientifically sound climate records that provide trustworthy information on how, where, and to what extent the land, oceans, atmosphere and ice sheets are changing. these datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with the longevity, consistency, and continuity to assess and measure climate variability and change. noaa cdrs are vetted using standards established by the national research council (nrc). climate data records are created by merging data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based systems across decades. noaaâs climate data records provides authoritative and traceable long-term climate records. noaa developed cdrs by applying modern data analysis methods to historical global satellite data. this process can clarify the underlying climate trends within the data and allows researchers and other users to identify economic and scientific value in these records. ncei maintains and extends cdrs by applying the same methods to present-day and future satellite measurements. terrestrial cdrs are composed of sensor data that have been improved and quality controlled over time, together w ... details → noaa u.s. climate gridded dataset (nclimgrid) agriculture climate meteorological weather the noaa monthly u.s. climate gridded dataset (nclimgrid) consists of four climate variables derived from the ghcn-d dataset: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature and precipitation. each file provides monthly values in a 5x5 lat/lon grid for the continental united states. data is available from 1895 to the present. on an annual basis, approximately one year of "final" nclimgrid will be submitted to replace the initially supplied "preliminary" data for the same time period. users should be sure to ascertain which level of data is required for their research. epinoaa is an analysis ready dataset that consists of a daily time-series of nclimgrid measures (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, and precipitation) at the county scale. each file provides daily values for the continental united states. data are available from 1951 to the present. daily data are updated every 3 days with a preliminary data file and replaced with the scaled (i.e., quality controlled) data file every three months. this derivative data product is an enhancement from the original daily nclimgrid dataset in that all four weather parameters are now p ... details → noaa unified forecast system (ufs) coastal model climate disaster response elevation geospatial lidar stac the unified forecast system (ufs) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive earth modeling system. the ufs coastal application is a project under development by noaa and ncar, which supports coastal forecasting requirements based on ufs standards. the coupling infrastructure for ufs coastal app is currently being developed based on a fork of the ufs-weather-model (ufs-wm), with additional coastal model-components including schism, adcirc, roms, and fvcom, as well as additional infrastructure to support coastal coupling of ww3 and cice. the model-level repository contains the model code and external submodules needed to build the ufs coastal model executable and the associated model components. the ufs coastal regression test (rt) system is a type of testing built into the software development that ensures
