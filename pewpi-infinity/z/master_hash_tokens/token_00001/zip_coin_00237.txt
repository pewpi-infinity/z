the ionosphere and plasmasphere from 90 km to approximately 10,000 km. wam fields of winds, temperature, and molecular and atomic atmospheric composition are coupled to ipe to enable the plasma to respond to changes driven by the neutral atmosphere. the operational wam-ipe is currently running in two different concepts of operation (conops) to produce results of nowcast and forecast. the wam-ipe real-time nowcast system (wrs) ingests real-time solar wind parameters every 5 minutes from noaaâs spacecrafts located at lagrange point 1 (l1) between the sun and earth in order to capture rapid changes in the ionosphere and thermosphere due to the sudden onset of geomagnetic storms. the nowcast is reinitialized every six hours to include the latest forcing from the lower atmosphere. the forecast system (wfs) runs four times daily (0, 6, 12, 18 ut), providing two-day forecasts. observed solar wind parameters are used whenever observational values are available, for the forecast portion, the forecasted 3-hour kp and daily f10.7 issued by swfo are ingested into the model to estimate solar wind parameters. lower atmospheric data assimilation only carries out twice daily at 0 and 12 ut cycles to maintain the stability of the coupled model. model version v1.2 became available in july 2023, featuring the implementation of the wrs into operations, as well as improvements to the kp-derived solar wind parameters utilized by wfs forecasts. the data files within this bucket are provided strictly on a non-operational basis, with no guarantee of timely delivery or availability. there may exist temporal gaps in coverage. the top-level versioned directories (v1.x) include netcdf files from operational runs providing 3-dimensional gridded neutral density every 10 minutes with an altitude range from 100 to 1000 km. wfs.yyyymmdd subdirectories contain two-day forecasts, updated four times daily (cycle initialization 00, 06, 12, 18 ut). wrs.yyyymmdd subdirectories contain real-time nowcast neutral density outputs, reinitialized ever ... details → nanopore reference human genome genetic genomic life sciences whole genome sequencing this dataset includes the sequencing and assembly of a reference standard human genome (gm12878) using the minion nanopore sequencing instrument with the r9.4 1d chemistry. details → natural scenes dataset computer vision image processing imaging life sciences machine learning magnetic resonance imaging neuroimaging neuroscience nifti here, we collected and pre-processed a massive, high-quality 7t fmri dataset that can be used to advance our understanding of how the brain works. a unique feature of this dataset is the massive amount of data available per individual subject. the data were acquired using ultra-high-field fmri (7t, whole-brain, 1.8-mm resolution, 1.6-s tr). we measured fmri responses while each of 8 participants viewed 9,000â10,000 distinct, color natural scenes (22,500â30,000 trials) in 30â40 weekly scan sessions over the course of a year. additional measures were collected including resting-state data, retin... details → ons open data portal electricity energy hydrography the ons open data portal, produced by the national operator of the electric system (ons), gathers historical data from the brazilian electricity sector in an easy and democratic way with the main objective to facilitate and improve the access and consumption of this type of content by all users and audiences. the portal gathers consolidated data on energy generation (hydraulic, thermal, solar and wind), areas of national and international energy exchange and energy load, information about equipments such as transmission lines, generating units, converters and others;
