of minimum 0.01 ha (a single 10m x 10m pixel) that is sowed/planted and harvest-able at least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date." this definition will exclude non-planted grazing lands and perennial crops which can be difficult for satellite imagery to differentiate from natural vegetation. this provisional cropland extent map has a resolution of 10m, and was built

ndvi climatology. a standardised anomaly is calculated by subtracting the long-term mean from an observation of interest and then dividing the result by the long-term standard deviation. positive ndvi anomaly values indicate vegetation is greener than average conditions, and are usually due to increased rainfall in a region. negative values indicate additional plant stress relative to t... details
