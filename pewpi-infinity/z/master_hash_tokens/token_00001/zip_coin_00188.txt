tomography (ct) images of 10,735 individuals suspected of being infected with sars-cov-2 during the first wave of the pandemic in france, from march to april 2020. for each patient in the training set, the dataset contains binary labels for covid-19 presence, based on rt-pcr test results, and covid-19 severity, defined as intubation or death within one month from the acquisition of the ct scan.

correction for oli âliteâ (acolite) software (version 20221114.0). aquatic reflectance is defined here as unitless water-leaving radiance reflectance and represents the ratio of water-leaving radiance (units of watts per square meter per steradian per nanometer) to downwelling irradiance (units of watts per square meter per nanometer) multiplied by pi. details → usage examples sentinel-2

(tglc) is a psf-based tess full-frame image (ffi) light curve product. using gaia dr3 as priors, the team forward models the ffis with the effective point spread function to remove contamination from nearby stars. the resulting light curves show a photometric precision closely tracking the pre-launch prediction of the noise level: tglc's photometric precision consistently reaches â²2% at 16th

from more than 80 organizations to comprehensively characterize the microbial communities inhabiting the human body and elucidate their role in human health and disease. to accomplish this task, microbial community samples were isolated from a cohort of 300 healthy adult human subjects at 18 specific sites within five regions of the body (oral cavity, airways, urogenital track, skin, and gut). targeted sequencing of the 16s bacterial marker gene and/or whole metagenome shotgun sequencing
