covid-19 foldingathome health life sciences molecular dynamics protein sars-cov-2 simulations structural biology folding@home is a massively distributed computing project that uses biomolecular simulations to investigate the molecular origins of disease and accelerate the discovery of new therapies. run by the folding@home consortium , a worldwide network of research laboratories focusing on a variety of different diseases, folding@home seeks to address problems in human health on a scale that is infeasible by another other means, sharing the results of these large-scale studies with the research community through peer-reviewed publications and publicly shared datasets. during the covid-19 epidemic , folding@home focused its resources on understanding the vulnerabilities in sars-cov-2 , the virus that causes covid-19 disease, and working closely with a number of experimental collaborators to accelerate progress toward effective therapies for treating covid-19 and ending the pandemic. in the process, it created the world's first exascale distributed computing resource , enabling it to generate valuable scientific datasets of unprecedented size. more information about folding@home's covid-19 research activities at the folding@home covid-19 page . in addition to working directly with experimental collaborators and rapidly sharing new research findings through preprint servers, folding@home has joined other researchers in committing to rapidly share all covid-19 research data , and has joined forces with aws and the molecular sciences software institute (molssi) to share datasets of unprecedented side through the aws open data registry , indexing these massive datasets via the molssi covid-19 molecular structure and therapeutics hub . the complete
