knowledge portal network bottom-line genetic associations genetic genome wide association study life sciences at the knowledge portal network, we aggregate and analyze genetic association results for a wide range of diseases and traits. for any given disease, a large number of individual genetic association datasets may have been generated. to make these results more interpretable, we meta-analyze all datasets for each phenotype, using a method that we term "bottom-line integrative analysis". here we provide the bottom-line summary statistic files for public download. details → usage examples

meteorological satellite imagery weather the geo-kompsat-2a (gk2a) is the new generation geostationary meteorological satellite (located in 128.2â°e) of the korea meteorological administration (kma). the main mission of the gk2a is to observe the atmospheric phenomena over the asia-pacific region. the advance meteorological imager (ami) on gk2a scan the earth full disk every 10 minutes and the korean peninsula area every 2 minutes with a high spatial resolution of 4 visible channels and 12 infrared channels. in addition, the ami has an ability of flexible target area scanning useful for monitoring severe weather events such as typhoon... details → usage examples gk2a full fact sheet by kma see 1 usage example → lofar elais-n1 cycle 2 observations on aws astronomy imaging survey these data correspond to the international lofar telescope observations of the sky field elais-n1 (16:10:01 +54:30:36) during the cycle 2 of observations. there are 11 runs of about 8 hours each plus the corresponding observation of the calibration targets before and after the target field. the data are measurement sets ( ms ) containing the cross-correlated data and metadata divided in 371 frequency sub-bands per target centred at ~150 mhz. details → usage examples calibration of lofar elais-n1 data in the amazon cloud by j. sabater see 1 usage example → land/sea static mask relevant to imerg

will no longer be available and have been superseded by version 2.this land sea mask originated from the noaa group at ssec in the 1980s. it was originally produced at 1/6 deg resolution, and then regridded for the purposes of gpcp, tmpa, and imerg precipitation products. nasa code 610.2, terrestrial information systems laboratory, restructured this land sea mask to match the imerg grid, and converted the file to cf-compliant netcdf4. version 2 was created in may, 2019 to resolve detected inaccuracies in coastal regions.users sho... details → usage examples how to access ges disc data
