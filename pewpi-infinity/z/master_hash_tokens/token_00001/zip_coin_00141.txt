effective october 25, 2022}( https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf2/scn22-91_nos_loofs_lsofs_v3.pdf ) for decades, mariners in the united states have depended on noaa's tide tables for the best estimate of expected water levels. these tables provide accurate predictions of the astronomical tide (i.e., the change in water level due to the gravitational effects of the moon and sun and the rotation of the earth); however, they cannot predict water-level changes due to wind, atmospheric pressure, and river flow, which are often significant. the national ocean service (nos) has the mission and mandate to provide guidance and information to support navigation and coastal needs. to support this mission, nos has been developing and implementing hydrodynamic model-based operational forecast systems . this forecast guidance provides oceanographic information that helps mariners safely navigate their local waters. this national network of hydrodynamic models provides users with operational nowcast and forecast guidance (out to 48 â 120 hours) on parameters such as water levels, water temperature, salinity, and currents. these forecast systems are implemented in critical ports, harbors, estuaries, great lakes and coastal waters of the united states, and form a national backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational modeling. nowcasts and forecasts are scientific predictions about the present and future states of water levels (and possibly currents and other relevant oceanographic variables, such as salinity and temperature) in a coastal area. these predictions rely on either observed data or forecasts from a numerical model. a nowcast incorporates recent (and often near real-time) observed meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate data. a nowcast covers the period from the recent past (e.g., the past few days) to the present, and it can make predictions for locations where observational data are not available. a forecast incorporates meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate forecasts and makes predictions for times where observational data will not be available. a forecast is usually initiated by the results of a nowcast. ofs generally runs four times per day (every 6 hours) on noaa's weather and climate operational supercomputing systems (wcoss) in a standard coastal ocean modeling framework (comf) developed by the center for operational oceanographic products and services (co-ops) . comf is a set... details → usage examples technical implementation notice for delaware river and bay ofs by noaa chesapeake bay ofs flyer by noaa delaware bay and river ofs flyer by noaa chesapeake bay ofs: model development and skill assessment by noaa tampa bay ofs: model development and skill assessment by noaa see 11 usage examples → the cancer dependency map (depmap) cancer cell line encyclopedia (ccle) dataset bam bioinformatics biology cancer genetic genomic homo sapiens life sciences short read sequencing transcriptomics whole exome sequencing whole genome sequencing this dataset consists of whole genome sequencing (wgs), whole exome sequencing (wes), and rna sequencing files generated from ~1000 cancer cell lines described in ghandi et al., 2019. details → usage examples depmap omics ccle data on the aws open data registry by devin mccabe the network zoo: a multilingual package for the inference and analysis of gene regulatory networks by ben guebila, wang, lopes-ramos et al. bridging the gap between cancer cell line models and tumours using gene expression data by noorbakhsh, vazquez & mcfarland the cancer dependency map (depmap) by arafeh, shibue, dempster et al. integrated cross-study datasets of genetic dependencies in cancer by pacini, dempster, boyle et al. see 11 usage examples → cbers on aws agriculture cog disaster response earth observation geospatial imaging satellite imagery stac imagery acquired by the china-brazil earth resources satellite (cbers), 4 and 4a. the image files are recorded and processed by instituto nacional de pesquisas espaciais (inpe) and are converted to cloud optimized geotiff format in order to optimize its use for cloud based applications. contains all cbers-4 mux, awfi, pan5m and pan10m scenes acquired since the start of the satellite mission and is daily updated with new scenes. cbers-4a mux level 4 (orthorectified) scenes are being ingested starting from 04-13-2021. cbers-4a wfi level 4 (orthorectified) scenes are being ingested starting from ... details → usage examples cbers-tiler by mapbox cbers static stac catalog served by stac-browser by radiant earth keeping a spatiotemporal asset catalog (stac) up to date with sns/sqs by frederico liporace stac v1.0.0 endpoint by scitekno using remote sensing images and cloud services on aws to improve land use and cover monitoring by k. r. ferreira, et al. see 10 usage examples → digital earth africa sentinel-1 radiometrically terrain corrected agriculture cog deafrica disaster response earth observation geospatial natural resource satellite imagery stac synthetic aperture radar de africaâs sentinel-1 backscatter product is developed to be compliant with the ceos analysis
