common fund's gabriella miller kids first pediatric research programâs (âkids firstâ) vision is to âalleviate suffering from childhood cancer and structural birth defects by fostering collaborative research to uncover the etiology of these diseases and by supporting data sharing within the pediatric research community.â the program continues to generate and share whole genome sequence data from thousands of children affected by these conditions, ranging from rare pediatric cancers, such as osteosarcoma, to more prevalent diagnoses, such as congenital heart defects. in 2018, kids fi... details → usage examples cavatica by seven bridges genomics genome-wide enrichment of de novo coding mutations in orofacial cleft trios. by madison r bishop, kimberly k diaz perez, et al. whole genome sequencing of orofacial cleft trios from the gabriella miller kids first pediatric research consortium identifies a new locus on chromosome 21. by nandita mukhopadhyay, madison bishop, et al. germline 16p11.2 microdeletion predisposes to neuroblastoma. by laura egolf, zalman vaksman, et al. development and clinical validation of a large fusion gene panel for pediatric cancers. by fengqi chang, fumin lin, et al. see 19 usage examples → noaa geostationary operational environmental satellites (goes) 16, 17, 18 & 19 agriculture disaster response earth observation geospatial meteorological satellite imagery weather new goes-19 data!! on april 4, 2025 at 1500 utc, the goes-19 satellite will be declared the operational goes-east satellite. all products and services, including nodd, for goes-east will transition to goes-19 data at that time. goes-19 will operate out of the goes-east location of 75.2â°w starting on april 1, 2025 and through the operational transition. until the transition time and during the final stretch of post launch product testing (plpt), goes-19 products are considered non-operational regardless of their validation maturity level. shortly following the transition of goes-19 to goes-east, all data distribution from goes-16 will be turned off. goes-16 will drift to the storage location at 104.7â°w. goes-19 data should begin flowing again on april 4th once this maneuver is complete. new goes 16 reprocess data!! the reprocessed goes-16 abi l1b data mitigates systematic data issues (including data gaps and image artifacts) seen in the operational products, and improves the stability of both the radiometric and geometric calibration over the course of the entire mission life. these data were produced by recomputing the l1b radiance products from input raw l0 data using improved calibration algorithms and look-up tables, derived from data analysis of the nist-traceable, on-board sources. in addition, the reprocessed data products contain enhancements to the l1b file format, including limb pixels and pixel timestamps, while maintaining compatibility with the operational products. the datasets currently available span the operational life of goes-16 abi, from early 2018 through the end of 2024. the reprocessed l1b dataset shows improvement over the operational l1b products but may still contain data gaps or discrepancies. please provide feedback to dan lindsey (dan.lindsey@noaa.gov) and gary lin (guoqing.lin-1@nasa.gov). more information can be found in the [goes-r abi reprocess user guide](https://github.com/noaa-big-data-program/nodd-data-docs/blob/main/goes/goes-r_abi_reprocessed_l1b_user_guide-v1.1.pdf). notice: as of january 10th 2023, goes-18 assumed the goes-west position and all data files are deemed both operational and provisional, so no âpreliminary, non-operationalâ caveat is needed. goes-17 is now offline, shifted approximately 105 degree west, where it will be in on-orbit storage. goes-17 data will no longer flow into the goes-17 bucket. operational goes-west products can be found in the goes-18 bucket. goes satellites (goes-16, goes-17, goes-18 & goes-19) provide continuous weather imagery and monitoring of meteorological and space environment data across north america. go ... details → usage examples processing goes-16 data with dask & aws fargate by zac flamig goes quick guides (spanish) by anthony segura garcã­a comparison reading goes-r data from aws s3 in netcdf versus zarr by chelle gentemann noaa goes16 julia jupyter notebook example by peter schmiedeskamp suncast: solar irradiance nowcasting from geosynchronous satellite data by dhileeban kumaresan, richard wang, ernesto martinez, richard cziva, alberto todeschini, colorado j reed, hossein vahabi see 19 usage examples → sentinel-2 cloud-optimized geotiffs agriculture cog disaster response earth observation geospatial natural resource satellite imagery stac the sentinel-2 mission is a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution optical imagery and provide continuity for the current spot and landsat missions. the mission provides a global coverage of the earth's land surface every 5 days, making the data of great use in ongoing studies. this dataset is the same as the sentinel-2 dataset, except the jp2k files were converted into cloud-optimized geotiffs (cogs). additionally, spatiotemporal asset catalog metadata has were in a json file alongside the data, and a stac api called earth-search is freely available t... details → usage examples fire detection twitter bot using satellite imagery by firewatch using sentinel-2 data from the aws open data project to measure water hyacinth growth by louise liddell access satellite imagery using python by the carpentries monitoring of methane (ch4) emission point sources on aws by janosch woschitz, karsten schroer stac, cog, python and qgis by andrew cutts see 19 usage examples → nasa prediction of worldwide energy resources (power) agriculture air quality analytics archives atmosphere climate climate model data assimilation deep learning earth observation energy environmental forecast geoscience geospatial global history imaging industry machine learning machine translation metadata meteorological model netcdf opendap radiation satellite imagery solar statistics sustainability time series forecasting water weather zarr nasa's goal in earth science is to observe, understand, and model the earth system to discover how it is changing, to better predict change, and to understand the consequences for life on earth. the applied sciences program, within the earth science division of the nasa science mission directorate, serves individuals and organizations around the globe by expanding and accelerating societal and economic benefits derived from earth science, information, and technology research and development. the prediction of worldwide energy resources (power) project, funded through the applied sciences program at nasa langley research center, gathers nasa earth observation data and parameters related to the fields of surface solar irradiance and meteorology to serve the public in several free, easy-to-access and easy-to-use methods. power helps communities become
