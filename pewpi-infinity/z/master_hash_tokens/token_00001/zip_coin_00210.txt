water tiles water xml the harmonized landsat sentinel-2 (hls) project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the operational land imager (oli) aboard the joint nasa/usgs landsat 8 satellite and the multi-spectral instrument (msi) aboard europeâs copernicus sentinel-2a, sentinel-2b, and sentinel-2c satellites. the combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2â3 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. the hls project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from oli and msi that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment. the hlss30 product provides 30-m nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function (brdf)-adjusted reflectance (nbar) and is derived from sentinel-2a, sentinel-2b, and sentinel-2c msi data products. the hlss30 and hlsl30 products are gridded to the same resolution and military grid reference system ( mgrs ) tiling system and thus are âstackableâ for time series analysis.the hlss30 product is provided in cloud optimized geotiff (cog) format, and each band is distributed as a separate cog. there are 13 bands included in the hlss30 product along with four angle bands and a quality assessment (qa) band. see the user guide for a more detailed description of the individual bands provided in the hlss30 product.known issues ... details → usage examples getting started with cloud-native hls data in python by mahsa jami, erik a. bolch, cole k. krehbiel, aaron

turbulence the archive comprises snapshot, point-probe, and time-average data produced via a high-fidelity computational simulation of turbulent air flow over a low pressure turbine blade, which is an important component in a jet engine. the simulation was undertaken using the open source pyfr flow solver on over 5000 nvidia k20x gpus of the titan supercomputer at oak ridge national laboratory under an incite award from the us doe. the data can be used to develop an enhanced understanding of the complex three-dimensional unsteady air flow patterns over turbine blades in jet engines. this

agriculture cropland partitioning irrigated cropland land cover land use rainfed cropland a framework integrating the budyko model has been developed to distinguish between rainfed and irrigated cropland areas across africa. this expands on remote sensing land cover products available for agricultural water studies in africa and thereby helps address the need for deeper insights into cropland patterns. validation against an independent dataset revealed an overall accuracy of 73% with high precision and specificity scores. these results validate the frameworkâs effectiveness in identifying irrigated areas while minimizing errors in misclassifying rainfed areas as irrigated. details → usage examples water use in awash basin by a. owusu, k. akpoti, m. leh, n. velpuri a
