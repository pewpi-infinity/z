Abstract:
The paper considers a non-reductionist theory of consciousness, which is not reducible to theories of reality and to physiological or psychological theories. Following

's "informational approach" to the "Mind-Brain Problem", we consider the reality through the prism of information about observed phenomena, which, in turn, is perceived by subjective reality through sensations, perceptions, feelings, etc., which, in turn, are information about the corresponding brain processes. Within this framework the following principle of the Information Theory of Consciousness (ITS) development is put forward: the brain discovers all possible causal relations in the external world and makes all possible inferences by them. The paper shows that ITS built on this principle: (1) also base on the information laws of the structure of external world; (2) explains the structure and functioning of the brain functional systems and cellular ensembles; (3) ensures maximum accuracy of predictions and the anticipation of reality; (4) resolves emerging contradictions and (5) is an information theory of the brain's reflection of reality.
