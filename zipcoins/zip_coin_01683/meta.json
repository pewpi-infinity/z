    "research": "Crystal Field Theory And Magnetic Point Groups\n\nThe author's previous work on the application of Wigner's theory of the coreps of non-unitary groups to the Shubnikov groups (magnetic groups) is here considered in relation to crystal field theory. Both the splitting of the energy levels and the symmetry properties of the wave function are considered in magnetic point groups. Examples of 4'mm' and 4m'm' are studied.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1071/ph660519"
