    "research": "TRLIF AND TRLIC LASER SPECTROSCOPY AND DETECTION OF ACTINIDES/LANTHANIDES IN SOLUTIONS\n\nAt present the most efficient methods of detection of actinides and lanthanides in solutions are methods based on registration of actinides with time resolution, time-resolved laser induced fluorescence (TRLIF) spectroscopy. TRLIF may be applied for biological samples analysis. Pu, Np, and some U compounds do not produce direct luminescence in solutions, but when excited by laser radiation, they can induce chemiluminescence of chemiluminogen (luminol in our experiments). The presence of a time delay between the pulse of laser radiation and the chemiluminescence pulse allows using time resolution (TR) procedure for detection of chemiluminescence (TRLIC). Using chemiluminescence of solutions, we found an approach to registration of plutonium, uranium, and other elements in solutions with a high sensitivity in excitation of plutonium and uranium with a pulse laser with tunable wavelength. A multi-step scheme of chemiluminescence excitation makes this procedure not only highly sensitive but also highly selective method of detection of substances.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.52676/1729-7885-2018-4-71-78"
