A molar mass influence on the aggregation number of micelles was found. The lower the molar mass, the higher the micelle aggregation number. The solubilization of polyisobutylene by micelles of these copolymers in methyl isobutyl ketone was also examined. The saturation concentrations of polyisobutylene solubilized by different block copolymers in methyl isobutyl ketone were determined by laser light scattering. The solubility curves found were linear and dependent on the molar mass of the polyisobutylene solubilized and the copolymer. The logarithm of the maximum amount of polyisobutylene solubilized by mass unity of the triblock copolymer varies linearly with the logarithm of the molar mass of the polyisobutylene. This variation is hardly dependent on the copolymer molar mass and strongly dependent on the type of block copolymer.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1002/macp.1995.021960519"
