Hydrogen Exchange on Benzonitrile Ion Salt as a Function of Alkali Metals\n\nAbstract\nThe para-orthohydrogen conversion (rate constant keH and the deuterium exchange reaction (rate constant keD) over the benzonitrile-alkali metal ion radical salt were investigated as functions of the donor component\u2013alkali metal. The sort of alkali metals in the ion radical salts greatly affected the catalytic activity and the reactivity. The activation energies obtained from the temperature dependence of keH and keD, EH and ED, and the value of \u03b1(depending on the ratio of keH to keD monotonously decreased as Na\u2192K\u2192Rb, but those values showed an irregular trend for the Cs-complex. The results suggest that the catalytic activity cannot be understood only in terms of the nature of the components; must also be considered the structural nature of the solid phase of the ion radical salt.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1246/bcsj.43.3415"
