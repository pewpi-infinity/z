    "research": "Surface Chemistry in Modern Nanotechnologies\n\nA review of the properties of fine oxide surfaces at the nano level is given based on the author's work. It includes a scheme related to the structure of pyrogenic silica and the changes induced by dehydroxylation as studied by quantum chemical and spectroscopic methods. The application of non-linear optical methods has appeared to be useful for the investigation of disperse solid structures. Quantitative measurements of intermolecular interaction have been obtained by light scattering.  Alteration of the surface activity due to gas-phase electron\u2013donor molecule action on chemisorbed complexes or functional groups on the surface is considered. It is also shown how the physicochemical properties of a solid surface can be changed as a result of chemical modification.  The investigations discussed could lead in practice to the creation of new lightweight ceramic materials, adsorbents, catalyst supports, hollow-body microspherical fillers and medicinal preparations. Some of these are useful for nano electronics and instrument design as well as for the solution of some meteorological problems.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1177/026361749601400504"
