The two bodies are treated as assemblies of infinitesimal volumes of pure components and the influence of the mutual potential fields examined. The results provide a thermodynamic description of surface tension and certain types of adsorption phenomena, as well as throwing considerable light on adsorption hysteresis.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1139/v55-117"
