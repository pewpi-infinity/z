    "research": "Recent Progress of Crystal Field Theory\n\nA brief account is given concerning the theoretical framework of the molecular orbital treatment of crystal field theory. Indirect and direct experimental evidences of electron delocalization are summarized. A historical survey is given of the theoretical treatment of cubic crystal field splitting. Finally, a molecular orbital treatment of the cubic field splitting is presented, emphasizing the importance of \u03c0-electron bonding and itinerancy of electrons between a metal ion and ligands.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1777112"
