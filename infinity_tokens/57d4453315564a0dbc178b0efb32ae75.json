    "The biosphere (from Ancient Greek \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 ( b\u00edos ) ' life ' and \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ( spha\u00eera ) ' sphere ' ), also called the ecosphere (from Ancient Greek \u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ( o\u00eekos ) ' settlement, house ' and \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ( spha\u00eera ) ' sphere ' ), is the worldwide sum of all ecosystems .",
    "It can also be termed the zone of life on the Earth .",
    "The biosphere (which is technically a spherical shell ) is virtually a closed system with regard to matter , [ 1 ] with minimal inputs and outputs.",
    "Regarding energy , it is an open system, with photosynthesis capturing solar energy at a rate of around 100 terawatts .",
    "[ 2 ] By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere , cryosphere , hydrosphere , and atmosphere .",
    "The biosphere is postulated to have evolved , beginning with a process of biopoiesis (life created naturally from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds) or biogenesis (life created from living matter), at least some 3.5 billion years ago.",
    "[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In a general sense, biospheres are any closed, self-regulating systems containing ecosystems.",
    "This includes artificial biospheres such as Biosphere 2 and BIOS-3 , and potentially ones on other planets or moons .",
    "[ 5 ] The term \"biosphere\" was coined in 1875 by geologist Eduard Suess , who defined it as the place on Earth's surface where life dwells.",
    "[ 6 ] While the concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the effect of both Charles Darwin and Matthew F.",
    "Maury on the Earth sciences .",
    "The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (see Vladimir I.",
    "Vernadsky ), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term \" ecosystem \" by Sir Arthur Tansley (see ecology history ).",
    "Vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere."

  "notes": "Einsteinium (\\(Es\\)) is a synthetic, radioactive element with atomic number 99, named after Albert Einstein. It is produced in minute quantities and has no practical applications outside of scientific research, mainly to synthesize heavier elements like mendelevium. Due to its radioactivity, it is difficult to study, but it has been investigated for its potential use in medical treatments. \u00a0     Discovery: First discovered in 1952 in the debris of the \"Ivy Mike\" nuclear test.\u00a0 Production: Created artificially by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in a reactor, causing them to undergo beta decay.\u00a0 Properties: Radioactivity: Extremely radioactive, to the point of emitting a visible glow and causing its own structure to break down over time.\u00a0 Physical appearance: Soft, silvery, paramagnetic metal, though its exact appearance is unknown due to its rarity.\u00a0 Chemical properties: Exhibits chemical properties typical of a heavy, trivalent actinide, but divalent and tetravalent states have also been reported.\u00a0 Uses: Heavy element synthesis: Primarily used to create other transuranium elements, such as mendelevium.\u00a0 Research: Studied to understand the effects of radiation damage and accelerated aging.\u00a0 Medical applications: Investigated for potential use in radiation therapy by attaching it to a biological agent to target cancer cells.\u00a0 Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.orgEinsteinium - WikipediaDue to the small amounts of einsteinium produced and the short half-life of its most common isotope, there are no practical applications for it except basic sci...National Institutes of Health (.gov)https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.govEinsteinium | Es (Element) - PubChem - NIHTracer studies using 253Es show that einsteinium has chemical properties typical of a heavy trivalent, actinide element.
