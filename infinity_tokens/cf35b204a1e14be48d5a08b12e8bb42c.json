    "The biosphere (from Ancient Greek \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 ( b\u00edos ) ' life ' and \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ( spha\u00eera ) ' sphere ' ), also called the ecosphere (from Ancient Greek \u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ( o\u00eekos ) ' settlement, house ' and \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 ( spha\u00eera ) ' sphere ' ), is the worldwide sum of all ecosystems .",
    "It can also be termed the zone of life on the Earth .",
    "The biosphere (which is technically a spherical shell ) is virtually a closed system with regard to matter , [ 1 ] with minimal inputs and outputs.",
    "Regarding energy , it is an open system, with photosynthesis capturing solar energy at a rate of around 100 terawatts .",
    "[ 2 ] By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere , cryosphere , hydrosphere , and atmosphere .",
    "The biosphere is postulated to have evolved , beginning with a process of biopoiesis (life created naturally from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds) or biogenesis (life created from living matter), at least some 3.5 billion years ago.",
    "[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In a general sense, biospheres are any closed, self-regulating systems containing ecosystems.",
    "This includes artificial biospheres such as Biosphere 2 and BIOS-3 , and potentially ones on other planets or moons .",
    "[ 5 ] The term \"biosphere\" was coined in 1875 by geologist Eduard Suess , who defined it as the place on Earth's surface where life dwells.",
    "[ 6 ] While the concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the effect of both Charles Darwin and Matthew F.",
    "Maury on the Earth sciences .",
    "The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (see Vladimir I.",
    "Vernadsky ), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term \" ecosystem \" by Sir Arthur Tansley (see ecology history ).",
    "Vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere."

  "notes": "The biosphere is the sum of all ecosystems on Earth, encompassing all regions where life exists, including the land (lithosphere), water (hydrosphere), and atmosphere. It includes all living organisms and the non-living factors necessary for their survival, functioning as the planet's life support system and a key element distinguishing Earth from other planets."
