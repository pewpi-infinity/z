    " An ecosystem (or ecological system ) is a system formed by organisms in interaction with their environment .",
    "[ 2 ] : 458 The biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.",
    "Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors .",
    "External factors\u2014including climate \u2014control the ecosystem's structure, but are not influenced by it.",
    "By contrast, internal factors control and are controlled by ecosystem processes; these include decomposition , the types of species present, root competition, shading, disturbance, and succession.",
    "While external factors generally determine which resource inputs an ecosystem has, their availability within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors.",
    "Ecosystems are dynamic , subject to periodic disturbances and always in the process of recovering from past disturbances.",
    "The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, is termed its resistance .",
    "Its capacity to absorb disturbance and reorganize, while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, is termed its ecological resilience .",
    "Ecosystems can be studied through a variety of approaches\u2014theoretical studies, studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long periods of time, those that look at differences between ecosystems to elucidate how they work and direct manipulative experimentation.",
    "Biomes are general classes or categories of ecosystems.",
    "However, there is no clear distinction between biomes and ecosystems.",
    "Ecosystem classifications are specific kinds of ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the definition of ecosystems: a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and within them, and the physical space they occupy.",
    "Biotic factors are living things; such as plants, while abiotic are non-living components; such as soil."
