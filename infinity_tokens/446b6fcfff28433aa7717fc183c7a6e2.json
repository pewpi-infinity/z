    "The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa via a thermocouple .",
    "[ 1 ] A thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side.",
    "Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference.",
    "[ 2 ] This effect can be used to generate electricity , measure temperature or change the temperature of objects.",
    "Because the direction of heating and cooling is affected by the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.",
    "The term \"thermoelectric effect\" encompasses three separately identified effects: the Seebeck effect (temperature differences cause electromotive forces), the Peltier effect (thermocouples create temperature differences), and the Thomson effect (the Seebeck coefficient varies with temperature).",
    "The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the Peltier\u2013Seebeck effect (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by Jean Charles Athanase Peltier and Thomas Johann Seebeck ).",
    "The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier\u2013Seebeck model and is credited to Lord Kelvin .",
    "Joule heating , the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a conductive material, is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect.",
    "The Peltier\u2013Seebeck and Thomson effects are thermodynamically reversible , [ 3 ] whereas Joule heating is not.",
    "At the atomic scale, a temperature gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.",
    "This is due to charge carrier particles having higher mean velocities (and thus kinetic energy ) at higher temperatures, leading them to migrate on average towards the colder side, in the process carrying heat across the material.",
    "[ 4 ] Depending on the material properties and nature of the charge carriers (whether they are positive holes in a bulk material or electrons of negative charge), heat can be carried in either direction with respect to voltage.",
    "Semiconductors of n-type and p-type are often combined in series as they have opposite directions for heat transport, as specified by the sign of their Seebeck coefficients ."
