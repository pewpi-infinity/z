# bcrypt is the preferred password hashing library (optional but recommended).
#
# If bcrypt is not installed, the script will fall back to SHA256 hashing,
# which is less secure but functional.
#
# Note: The HTTP server uses Python's built-in http.server module, so no
# additional web framework is required.

# Optional but recommended for secure password hashing
# Comment out if bcrypt installation fails (e.g., missing build tools)
bcrypt>=4.0.0
